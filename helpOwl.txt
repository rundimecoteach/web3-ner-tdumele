[ 18 ]...— I —...[ 1 ]..Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of.lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed
Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned.his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking.gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light.untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak...Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the.bowl smartly...—Back to barracks! he said sternly...He added in a preacher’s tone:..—For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul.and blood and ouns
Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily.halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as.he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and.lathered cheeks and neck...Buck Mulligan’s gay voice went on...—My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls
Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out.twenty quid?..He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:..—Will he come? The jejune jesuit!..Ceasing, he began to shave with care...—Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly...—Yes, my love?..—How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?..Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder...—God, isn’t he dreadful? he said frankly
O, my name for you.is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade...He shaved warily over his chin...—He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said
If.he stays on here I am off...Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade
He hopped down.from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily...—Scutter! he cried thickly...He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen’s upper.pocket, said:..—Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor...Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a.dirty crumpled handkerchief
Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly..Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:..—The bard’s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen..You can almost taste it, can’t you?..He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair.oakpale hair stirring slightly...—God! he said quietly
Leaning on it he looked.down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of.Kingstown...—Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said...He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen’s.face...—The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said
That’s why she won’t.let me have anything to do with you...—Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily...—You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother.asked you, Buck Mulligan said
Kinch, the loveliest.mummer of them all!..He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously...Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against.his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve..Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart
A bowl of white china had.stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had.torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting...Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade...—Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice
How are the secondhand breeks?..—They fit well enough, Stephen answered...Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip...—The mockery of it, he said contentedly
I can’t wear them if they are grey...—He can’t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror..Etiquette is etiquette
He kills his mother but he can’t wear grey.trousers...He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the.smooth skin...Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its.smokeblue mobile eyes...—That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan,.says you have g
He’s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman..General paralysis of the insane!..He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings.abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea
It asks me too...—I pinched it out of the skivvy’s room, Buck Mulligan said
The cracked lookingglass of a servant...Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen’s and walked with him.round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he.had thrust them...—It’s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly..God knows you have more spirit than any of them...Parried again
Why don’t you trust me more? What have you up.your nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I’ll.bring down Seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave.Clive Kempthorpe...Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe’s rooms
A deaf.gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold’s face, pushes his mower.on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms...To ourselves..
There’s nothing wrong with him except at.night...—Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently
Stephen freed his arm.quietly...—Do you wish me to tell you? he asked...—Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered
A light wind passed his brow,.fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of.anxiety in his eyes...Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:..—Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’s.death?..Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:..—What? Where? I can’t remember anything
She asked you who was in your room...—Yes? Buck Mulligan said
What did I say? I forget...—You said, Stephen answered, _O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother is.beastly dead._..A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck.Mulligan’s cheek...—Did I say that? he asked
She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks.buttercups off the quilt
Stephen, shielding the gaping.wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:..—I am not thinking of the offence to my mother...—Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked...—Of the offence to me, Stephen answered...Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel...—O, an impossible person! he exclaimed...He walked off quickly round the parapet
Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he.felt the fever of his cheeks...A voice within the tower called loudly:..—Are you up there, Mulligan?..—I’m coming, Buck Mulligan answered...He turned towards Stephen and said:..—Look at the sea
She heard old Royce sing.in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he.sang:.
_Liliata.rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum.chorus excipiat._..Ghoul! Chewer of corpses!..No, mother! Let me be and let me live...—Kinch ahoy!..Buck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower
It’s all right...—I’m coming, Stephen said, turning...—Do, for Jesus’ sake, Buck Mulligan said
Touch.him for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean...—I get paid this morning, Stephen said...—The school kip? Buck Mulligan said
How much? Four quid? Lend us one...—If you want it, Stephen said...—Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight
A server of a servant...In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan’s gowned form.moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its.yellow glow
Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor.from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of.coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning...—We’ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said
A tall figure rose from the.hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open.the inner doors...—Have you the key? a voice asked...—Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said
Janey Mack, I’m choked!..He howled, without looking up from the fire:..—Kinch!..—It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward...The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been.set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered
Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside.him
But, hush! Not a.word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey..Haines, come in
Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet...—What sort of a kip is this? he said
There’s a lemon in the.locker...—O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said
I want Sandycove.milk...Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:..—That woman is coming up with the milk...—The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his.chair
But, I say, Mulligan, you do.make strong tea, don’t you?..Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old.woman’s wheedling voice:..—When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said
And when I.makes water I makes water...—By Jove, it is tea, Haines said...Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:..—_So I do, Mrs Cahill,_ says she
_Begob, ma’am,_ says Mrs Cahill, _God.send you don’t make them in the one pot._..He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled.on his knife...—That’s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines
Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind...He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his.brows:..—Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot spoken.of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?..—I doubt it, said Stephen gravely...—Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone
Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann...Buck Mulligan’s face smiled with delight...—Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth.and blinking his eyes pleasantly
Do you think she was? Quite charming!..Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened.rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:.._—For old Mary Ann..She doesn’t care a damn...But, hising up her petticoats..._..He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned...The doorway was darkened by an entering form...—The milk, sir!..—Come in, ma’am, Mulligan said
Ah, to be sure!..Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker...—The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of.the collector of prepuces...—How much, sir? asked the old woman...—A quart, Stephen said...He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white.milk, not hers
To serve or to.upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour...—It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups...—Taste it, sir, she said...He drank at her bidding...—If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat.loudly, we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten.guts
Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved.with dust, horsedung and consumptives’ spits...—Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked...—I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered...—Look at that now, she said...Stephen listened in scornful silence
And to the loud voice that now bids.her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes...—Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her...—Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines...Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently...—Irish, Buck Mulligan said
Are you from the.west, sir?..—I am an Englishman, Haines answered...—He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak.Irish in Ireland...—Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t speak.the language myself
I’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows...—Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan
Would you like a cup, ma’am?..—No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the.milkcan on her forearm and about to go...Haines said to her:..—Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?..Stephen filled again the three cups...—Bill, sir? she said, halting
That’s a.shilling and one and two is two and two, sir...Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly.buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search.his trouser pockets...—Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling...Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the.thick rich milk
Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in.his fingers and cried:..—A miracle!..He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:..—Ask nothing more of me, sweet
Good.morning, sir...She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan’s tender chant:.._—Heart of my heart, were it more,..More would be laid at your feet._..He turned to Stephen and said:..—Seriously, Dedalus
Ireland.expects that every man this day will do his duty...—That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your.national library today...—Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said...He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:..—Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?..Then he said to Haines:..—The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month...—All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey.trickle over a slice of the loaf...Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the.loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:..—I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me...Speaking to me
Yet here’s a spot...—That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol.of Irish art is deuced good...Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with.warmth of tone:..—Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines...—Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen
I was just.thinking of it when that poor old creature came in...—Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked...Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of.the hammock, said:..—I don’t know, I’m sure...He strolled out to the doorway
Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen.and said with coarse vigour:..—You put your hoof in it now
It’s a toss up, I think...—I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along.with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes...—I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him...Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm...—From me, Kinch, he said...In a suddenly changed tone he added:..—To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right
Mercurial Malachi
Haines called to them from the.doorway:..—Are you coming, you fellows?..—I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door
He put the huge key in his inner pocket...At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:..—Did you bring the key?..—I have it, Stephen said, preceding them...He walked on
Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy.bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses...—Down, sir! How dare you, sir!..Haines asked:..—Do you pay rent for this tower?..—Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said...—To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder...They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:..—Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say
Martello you call it?..—Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on.the sea
But ours is the _omphalos_...—What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen...—No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain
Wait till I.have a few pints in me first...He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his.primrose waistcoat:..—You couldn’t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?..—It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer...—You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably
Is it some paradox?..—Pooh! Buck Mulligan said
He proves by algebra that Hamlet’s grandson is.Shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own.father...—What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen
He himself?..Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in.loose laughter, said to Stephen’s ear:..—O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!..—We’re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines
And it is.rather long to tell...Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands...—The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said...—I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this.tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore
_That.beetles o’er his base into the sea,_ isn’t it?..Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did.not speak
In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in.cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires...—It’s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again...Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent..The seas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the.smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail.tacking by the Muglins...—I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused..The Father and the Son idea
The Son striving to be atoned with the.Father...Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face
He moved.a doll’s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and.began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:.._—I’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard..My mother’s a jew, my father’s a bird..With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree..So here’s to disciples and Calvary._..He held up a forefinger of warning..._—If anyone thinks that I amn’t divine.He’ll get no free drinks when I’m making the wine.But have to drink water and wish it were plain.That I make when the wine becomes water again._..He tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running.forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like.fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:.._—Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said.And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead..What’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly.And Olivet’s breezy..
Goodbye, now, goodbye!_..He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his.winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh.wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries...Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and.said:..—We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose
Still his gaiety takes the harm out of.it somehow, doesn’t it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?..—The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered...—O, Haines said, you have heard it before?..—Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily...—You’re not a believer, are you? Haines asked
Creation from nothing and miracles and a.personal God...—There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said...Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a.green stone
He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it...—Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette...Haines helped himself and snapped the case to
That was in his.eyes...—After all, Haines began.....Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was.not all unkind...—After all, I should think you are able to free yourself
You are your.own master, it seems to me...—I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an.Italian...—Italian? Haines said...A crazy queen, old and jealous
Kneel down before me...—And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs...—Italian? Haines said again
What do you mean?..—The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and.the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church...Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he.spoke...—I can quite understand that, he said calmly
Symbol of the apostles in the mass.for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in.affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church.militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs
A horde of heresies.fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom.Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the.consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning.Christ’s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who.held that the Father was Himself His own Son
Words Mulligan had spoken.a moment since in mockery to the stranger
The void.awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a.worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael’s host, who.defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their.shields...Hear, hear! Prolonged applause
_Zut! Nom de Dieu!_..—Of course I’m a Britisher, Haines’s voice said, and I feel as one
Buck Mulligan stood.on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his.shoulder
Photo girl he calls her...—Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure...Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots
He scrambled up by the stones,.water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water.rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black.sagging loincloth...Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines.and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and.lips and breastbone...—Seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of.rock
Chucked medicine and going in for the army...—Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said...—Going over next week to stew
The father is rotto with.money...—Is she up the pole?..—Better ask Seymour that...—Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said...He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying.tritely:..—Redheaded women buck like goats...He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt...—My twelfth rib is gone, he cried
Haines sat down on a.stone, smoking...—Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked...—Later on, Haines said
Not on my breakfast...Stephen turned away...—I’m going, Mulligan, he said...—Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat...Stephen handed him the key
Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped.clothes...—And twopence, he said, for a pint
Thus spake.Zarathustra...His plump body plunged...—We’ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the.path and smiling at wild Irish...Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon...—The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried
They lend ear...—You, Armstrong, Stephen said
Vico Road, Dalkey...—Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier...All laughed
In a moment they will laugh.more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay...—Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy’s shoulder with the book,.what is a pier...—A pier, sir, Armstrong said
For them too history was a tale like any other.too often heard, their land a pawnshop...Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not.been knifed to death
A ghoststory...—Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another book...—_Weep no more,_ Comyn said...—Go on then, Talbot...—And the story, sir?..—After, Stephen said
He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:.._—Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more.For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,.Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor..._..It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible..Aristotle’s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated.out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where.he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night
Thursday...—Who can answer a riddle? Stephen asked...They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling..Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all.gabbling gaily:..—A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir...—O, ask me, sir...—A hard one, sir...—This is the riddle, Stephen said:.
Cyril Sargent: his name and seal...—Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them.to you, sir...Stephen touched the edges of the book
Gone too from.the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and.movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the.world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not.comprehend...—Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?..—Yes, sir...In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data
Thanks, Sargent answered...He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his.copybook back to his bench...—You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said.as he followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form...—Yes, sir...In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield...—Sargent!..—Run on, Stephen said
Stephen’s embarrassed hand moved.over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money.cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir’s turban, and.this, the scallop of saint James
His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems.history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating...—That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets...—Ba! Mr Deasy cried
Fred Ryan, two shillings..Temple, two lunches
Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob.Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five.weeks’ board
The lump I have is useless...—For the moment, no, Stephen answered...Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox...—I knew you couldn’t, he said joyously
But one day you must feel it..We are a generous people but we must also be just...—I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy...Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the.shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of.Wales...—You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said..I saw three generations since O’Connell’s time
The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the.splendid behung with corpses of papishes
But.I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union
He voted for.it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to.do so..
Framed.around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek.heads poised in air: lord Hastings’ _Repulse_, the duke of.Westminster’s _Shotover_, the duke of Beaufort’s _Ceylon_, _prix de.Paris_, 1866
Even money _Fair Rebel._ Ten to.one the field
Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme..European conflagration
To come to the point at issue...—I don’t mince words, do I? Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on...Foot and mouth disease
Mr Henry Blackwood Price
My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is.regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there
    Shall weave old England’s windingsheet...His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which.he halted...—A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or.gentile, is he not?..—They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely
A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on..Their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the.dishonours of their flesh...—Who has not? Stephen said...—What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked...He came forward a pace and stood by the table
All human.history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God...Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:..—That is God...Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!..—What? Mr Deasy asked...—A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders...Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked.between his fingers
For a woman who was no.better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten.years the Greeks made war on Troy
A faithless wife first brought the.strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough’s wife and her leman,.O’Rourke, prince of Breffni
    And Ulster will be right...Stephen raised the sheets in his hand...—Well, sir, he began...—I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at.this work
Perhaps I am.wrong...—A learner rather, Stephen said...And here what will you learn more?..Mr Deasy shook his head...—Who knows? he said
No more letters, I hope...—Just one moment...—Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate...Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath...—I just wanted to say, he said

Lover, for her.love he prowled with colonel Richard Burke, tanist of his sept, under.the walls of Clerkenwell and, crouching, saw a flame of vengeance hurl.them upward in the fog
In gay.Paree he hides, Egan of Paris, unsought by any save by me
She is quite nicey comfy without her outcast man, madame in.rue Gît-le-Cœur, canary and two buck lodgers
He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand..
They have forgotten Kevin Egan, not he them..Remembering thee, O Sion...He had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots..The new air greeted him, harping in wild nerves, wind of wild air of.seeds of brightness

He smiled, pleasing himself..What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_.leader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway.behind the bank of Ireland
Sad thing about poor.Dignam, Mr O’Rourke...Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the.doorway:..—Good day, Mr O’Rourke...—Good day to you...—Lovely weather, sir...—’Tis all that...Where do they get the money? Coming up redheaded curates from the.county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar
Then, lo and.behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons

Jack Fleming.embezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America
He saw his trunk.and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward,.lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of.his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father.of thousands, a languid floating flower....[ 6 ]..Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking.carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself

Come along, Bloom...Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place
The wheels.rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook.rattling in the doorframes...—What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows...—Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said
He was alone...—Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding.faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa’s little lump.of dung, the wise child that knows her own father...Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road

O jumping.Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she’s a dear girl

Martin Cunningham began to brush away.crustcrumbs from under his thighs...—What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?..—Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power.said...All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless.leather of the seats
What do you think, Martin?..—It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said...Mr Bloom set his thigh down
But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better...Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly...—After all, he said, it’s the most natural thing in the world...—Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of.his beard gently...—Yes, Mr Bloom answered

He caressed his beard, adding:..—Well, nearly all of us...Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions’ faces...—That’s an awfully good one that’s going the rounds about Reuben J and.the son...—About the boatman? Mr Power asked...—Yes
I didn’t hear it...—There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to.send him to the Isle of Man out of harm’s way but when they were.both.......—What? Mr Dedalus asked
I wish to Christ he did!..Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils...—No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.......Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:..—Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on.their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got.loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey...—For God’s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright
Is he dead?..—Dead! Martin Cunningham cried
But the funny part is.......—And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for.saving his son’s life...A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power’s hand...—O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed

We.must take a charitable view of it...—They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said...—It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said...Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again
Over the stones...—We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said...—God grant he doesn’t upset us on the road, Mr Power said...—I hope not, Martin Cunningham said

All those animals could be taken.in trucks down to the boats...—Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said
They ought to...—Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have.municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know
Wouldn’t it be more decent.than galloping two abreast?..—Well, there’s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted...—And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn’t have scenes like that when.the hearse capsized round Dunphy’s and upset the coffin on to the road...—That was terrible, Mr Power’s shocked face said, and the corpse fell.about the road

I suppose she is in.heaven if there is a heaven...Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to.plod by...—Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely...Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head...—The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said
Hope he’ll say something else...Mr Kernan added:..—The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more.impressive I must say...Mr Bloom gave prudent assent
Troy.measure...Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side...—Everything went off A1, he said
With.your tooraloom tooraloom...—As it should be, Mr Kernan said...—What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said...Mr Kernan assured him...—Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked

I don’t want.your custom at all...Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin.Cunningham’s side puzzling two long keys at his back...—Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?..—I did not, Martin Cunningham said...They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear
One of the.drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy
The other drunk was.blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up...The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed
_That’s not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_...Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher,.accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as.he walked...—That’s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes...—I know, Hynes said
I know that...—To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said

Iron nerves..Maybe he understands what I...The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began.to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket...—Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top...Let him take that in first...Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the.foreman’s sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the.obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper

Hail fellow well met the next moment...—Ah, listen to this for God’ sake, Ned Lambert pleaded
Enough of the inflated.windbag!..—_Peaks_, Ned Lambert went on, _towering high on high, to bathe our.souls, as it were..._..—Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said
Blessed and eternal God! Yes? Is he.taking anything for it?.._—As ’twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland’s portfolio,.unmatched, despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize.regions, for very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and.luscious pastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent.translucent glow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight..._..HIS NATIVE DORIC...—The moon, professor MacHugh said
Life is too short...He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy.moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers...Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight
He was in the bakery line too, wasn’t he? Why they.call him Doughy Daw
The bold blue eyes stared.about them and the harsh voice asked:..—What is it?..—And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said.grandly...—Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition...—Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat
Come on, Ned...Ned Lambert sidled down from the table
The editor’s blue eyes roved.towards Mr Bloom’s face, shadowed by a smile...—Will you join us, Myles? Ned Lambert asked...MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED...—North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece
We.won every time! North Cork and Spanish officers!..—Where was that, Myles? Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at.his toecaps...—In Ohio! the editor shouted...—So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed...Passing out he whispered to J
I just want to phone about an ad...He went in...—What about that leader this evening? professor MacHugh asked, coming.to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder...—That’ll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly
Yes...SPOT THE WINNER...Lenehan came out of the inner office with _Sport_’s tissues...—Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup? he asked
Sceptre with O..Madden up...He tossed the tissues on to the table...Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was.flung open...—Hush, Lenehan said
It was Pat.Farrell shoved me, sir...He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe...—Him, sir...—Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly...He hustled the boy out and banged the door to...J
O’Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking:..—Continued on page six, column four...—Yes, _Evening Telegraph_ here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office..Is the boss...? Yes, _Telegraph_..
He came in quickly and bumped.against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue...—_Pardon, monsieur_, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and.making a grimace...—My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip
Are you hurt? I’m in a.hurry...—Knee, Lenehan said...He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:..—The accumulation of the _anno Domini_...—Sorry, Mr Bloom said...He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused
    Who fought with heart and hand...EXIT BLOOM...—I’m just running round to Bachelor’s walk, Mr Bloom said, about this.ad of Keyes’s
Where? Lenehan cried, running to the window...A STREET CORTÈGE...Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr.Bloom’s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a.tail of white bowknots...—Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said,.and you’ll kick
O’Molloy who placed the tissues in his.receiving hands...—What’s that? Myles Crawford said with a start
Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall
    ’Twas empire charmed thy heart...The professor grinned, locking his long lips...—Eh? You bloody old Roman empire? Myles Crawford said...He took a cigarette from the open case
You and I are the fat in the fire..We haven’t got the chance of a snowball in hell...THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME...—Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws

Saving princes is a thank you job...Professor MacHugh turned on him...—And if not? he said...—I’ll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began

_Kyrie eleison!_.The closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit..We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered.at Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an _imperium,_ that.went under with the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami
Pyrrhus, misled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve.the fortunes of Greece

Holohan told me..You know Holohan?..—Hop and carry one, is it? Myles Crawford said...—And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for.the corporation

Cabled right away..Have you _Weekly Freeman_ of 17 March? Right

Lady Dudley was walking home.through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that.cyclone last year and thought she’d buy a view of Dublin
And it turned.out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or.Skin-the-Goat
Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine!..—They’re only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said..Psha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those.fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O’Hagan..Eh? Ah, bloody nonsense
Psha! Only in the halfpenny place...His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain...Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss? How do you know? Why did you.write it then?..RHYMES AND REASONS...Mouth, south
Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes.and Edmund Burke? Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod.boss, Harmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the.Bowery guttersheet not to mention _Paddy Kelly’s Budget_, _Pue’s.Occurrences_ and our watchful friend _The Skibbereen Eagle_

Dr Lucas..Who have you now like John Philpot Curran? Psha!..—Well, J
Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe...—He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for....
O’Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly:..—One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life.fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe
And he.cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican...—Ha...—A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced
O’Molloy resumed, moulding his words:..—He said of it: _that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and.terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and.of prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of.sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of.soultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves to live._..His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall...—Fine! Myles Crawford said at once...—The divine afflatus, Mr O’Madden Burke said...—You like it? J
O’Molloy asked Stephen...Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed
O’Molloy offered his case to.Myles Crawford

The finest display of oratory I.ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical.society
Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had.spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days),.advocating the revival of the Irish tongue...He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:..—You know Gerald Fitzgibbon
Then you can imagine the style of his.discourse...—He is sitting with Tim Healy, J
Still seeking, he said:..—When Fitzgibbon’s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply..Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these...He raised his head firmly
You have but emerged from.primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong.history and a polity._..Nile...Child, man, effigy...By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple.in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone..._—You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and.mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra..Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas

Crawford will.follow...Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran:..—Racing special!..DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN...Dubliners...—Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty.and fiftythree years in Fumbally’s lane...—Where is that? the professor asked...—Off Blackpitts, Stephen said...Damp night reeking of hungry dough
Let there be life...—They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson’s pillar..They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox
They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their.umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain...—Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said...LIFE ON THE RAW...—They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at.the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate.Collins, proprietress..
Glory be to God..They had no idea it was that high...Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe
Anne Kearns has the.lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who.got a bottleful from a passionist father
Florence MacCabe takes a.crubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday...—Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice
Hard after them.Myles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet.face, talking with J
O’Molloy...—Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm...He set off again to walk by Stephen’s side...RETURN OF BLOOM...—Yes, he said
I see them...Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the.offices of the _Irish Catholic_ and _Dublin Penny Journal_, called:..—Mr Crawford! A moment!..—_Telegraph_! Racing special!..—What is it? Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace...A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom’s face:..—Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows!..INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR...—Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps,.puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket
And he wants it copied if it’s not too late I told.councillor Nannetti from the _Kilkenny People_

Two old.Dublin women on the top of Nelson’s pillar...SOME COLUMN!—THAT’S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID...—That’s new, Myles Crawford said

I see what you mean...DAMES DONATE DUBLIN’S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF...—It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too.tired to look up or down or to speak
And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of.beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope...Poor Penelope
Penelope Rich...They made ready to cross O’Connell street...HELLO THERE, CENTRAL!...At various points along the eight lines tramcars with motionless.trolleys stood in their tracks, bound for or from Rathmines,.Rathfarnham, Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Sandymount Green,.Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Donnybrook, Palmerston Park and Upper.Rathmines, all still, becalmed in short circuit
Hackney cars, cabs,.delivery waggons, mailvans, private broughams, aerated mineral water.floats with rattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled, horsedrawn,.rapidly...WHAT?—AND LIKEWISE—WHERE?...—But what do you call it? Myles Crawford asked
O’Molloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue and held.his peace...—I see, the professor said...He halted on sir John Gray’s pavement island and peered aloft at Nelson.through the meshes of his wry smile...DIMINISHED DIGITS PROVE TOO TITILLATING FOR FRISKY FRUMPS

Father.Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square.east...Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate.frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender.trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave.deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady.Maxwell at the corner of Dignam’s court...Was that not Mrs M’Guinness?..Mrs M’Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the.farther footpath along which she sailed

She passed out with her basket and a.marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and.basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed.the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had.always to be told twice _bless you, my child,_ that they have been.absolved, _pray for me._ But they had so many worries in life, so many.cares, poor creatures...From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at.Father Conmee...Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men.and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S

We are standing in the historic.council chamber of saint Mary’s abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed.himself a rebel in 1534
This is the most historic spot in all Dublin..O’Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days..The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and.the original jews’ temple was here too before they built their.synagogue over in Adelaide road

Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn’t do.anything! O, sure they wouldn’t really! Is it little sister Monica!..*    *    *...From the sundial towards James’s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with.the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James’s.street, past Shackleton’s offices

Hasn’t your landlord distrained for rent?..—He has, Father Cowley said...—Then our friend’s writ is not worth the paper it’s printed on, Ben.Dollard said
But are you sure of that?..—You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that.writ where Jacko put the nuts...He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk...—Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his.glasses on his coatfront, following them...*    *    *...—The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they.passed out of the Castleyard gate...The policeman touched his forehead...—God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily...He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on.towards Lord Edward street...Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head, appeared.above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel...—Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard

A couched spear of acuminated granite rested.by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe.whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a.supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which.his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a.mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone...So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the.sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid
A goodlooking sovereign...—And there’s more where that came from, says he...—Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I...—Sweat of my brow, says Joe

Bob’s a queer chap when.the porter’s up in him so says I just to make talk:..—How’s Willy Murray those times, Alf?..—I don’t know, says Alf
I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy.Dignam
With who?..—With Dignam, says Alf...—Is it Paddy? says Joe...—Yes, says Alf
Why?..—Don’t you know he’s dead? says Joe...—Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf...—Ay, says Joe...—Sure I’m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as.a pikestaff...—Who’s dead? says Bob Doran...—You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm...—What? says Alf
What? Dignam.dead?..—What about Dignam? says Bob Doran
Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted.all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true.path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were.out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power
doesn’t pile it on._ It was ascertained.that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H..J
Before departing he requested that it should be told to.his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for.was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair.should be sent to Cullen’s to be soled only as the heels were still.good
He’s on point duty up and down there for the last ten.minutes...And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again...Little Alf was knocked bawways
I could have sworn it was him...And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest.blackguard in Dublin when he’s under the influence:..—Who said Christ is good?..—I beg your parsnips, says Alf...—Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy.Dignam?..—Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off
He’s over all his troubles...But Bob Doran shouts out of him...—He’s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam...Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn’t.want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises
And Bob.Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you’re there...—The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character...The tear is bloody near your eye
Talking through his bloody hat..Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married,.Mooney, the bumbailiff’s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke.street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told.me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on.her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour...—The noblest, the truest, says he
And he’s gone, poor little Willy,.poor little Paddy Dignam...And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that.beam of heaven...Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round.the door...—Come in, come on, he won’t eat you, says the citizen...So Bloom slopes in with his cod’s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was.Martin Cunningham there...—O, Christ M’Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters
           Dublin._..._Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful.case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i.hanged..._..—Show us, Joe, says I...—_..

           Master Barber._...—And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen...—And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe
Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you.have?..So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn’t and.he couldn’t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said.well he’d just take a cigar
Gob, he’s a prudent member and no mistake...—Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe...And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with.a black border round it...—They’re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang.their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses...And he was telling us there’s two fellows waiting below to pull his.heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they.chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull...In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor
Their.deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever.wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so.saith the Lord...So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom.comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the.business and the old dog smelling him all the time I’m told those.jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about.I don’t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on...—There’s one thing it hasn’t a deterrent effect on, says Alf...—What’s that? says Joe...—The poor bugger’s tool that’s being hanged, says Alf...—That so? says Joe...—God’s truth, says Alf
I heard that from the head warder that was in.Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible
He told me when.they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like.a poker...—Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said...—That can be explained by science, says Bloom
It’s only a natural.phenomenon, don’t you see, because on account of the.....And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science.and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon...The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered.medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the.cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,.according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be.calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent.ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus,.thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly.dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood.to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ.resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a.morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo.mortis per diminutionem capitis._..So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and.he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard.and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe.with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported.for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this,.that and the other
And round he goes to Bob.Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could.get
So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:..—Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw.here! Give us the paw!..Arrah, bloody end to the paw he’d paw and Alf trying to keep him from.tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking.all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and.intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip
Near ate the tin and all, hungry.bloody mongrel...And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the.brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet.and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and.she’s far from the land
Phenomenon! The fat heap he.married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley..Time they were stopping up in the _City Arms_ pisser Burke told me.there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and.Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing.bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating.meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and.taking the lout out for a walk
And one time he led him the rounds of.Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought.him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him.the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn’t near.roast him, it’s a queer story, the old one, Bloom’s wife and Mrs O’Dowd.that kept the hotel
Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them.off chewing the fat
Phenomenon!..—The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and.glaring at Bloom...—Ay, ay, says Joe...—You don’t grasp my point, says Bloom
A posse of Dublin.Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person.maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and.reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on.their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from.the cradle by Speranza’s plaintive muse
Considerable.amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and.M-ll-g-n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual.mirth-provoking fashion
The delegation,.present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone.(the semiparalysed _doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his.seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul.Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the.Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha.Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y

The baby policeman, Constable.MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly.restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth.of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending.parties
Constable MacFadden was heartily.congratulated by all the F
On a.handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering.knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially.supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and.Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the.duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully.extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most.precious blood of the most precious victim
She.brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood.together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the.innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present,.they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable.pastor, joining in the general merriment
Every.lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the.occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and.generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the.gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most.timehonoured names in Albion’s history) placed on the finger of his.blushing _fiancée_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in.the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds
Blimey it.makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause.I thinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down Limehouse way...So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the.corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak.their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a.quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he.cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the.antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland
And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their.musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of.hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly.blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen.bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and.oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh.entertainment, don’t be talking
Ireland sober is Ireland free
Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth.is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws...All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the.lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not.missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the.famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_.of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends.and acquaintances Owen Garry
    On you, Barney Kiernan,
And Joe asked him would he have.another...—I will, says he, _a chara_, to show there’s no ill feeling...Gob, he’s not as green as he’s cabbagelooking
And says Joe:..—Could you make a hole in another pint?..—Could a swim duck? says I...—Same again, Terry, says Joe
As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet.Martin Cunningham, don’t you see, about this insurance of poor.Dignam’s
You see, he, Dignam, I.mean, didn’t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the.time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can’t recover on the.policy...—Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old Shylock is.landed
So the wife comes out top dog, what?..—Well, that’s a point, says Bloom, for the wife’s admirers...—Whose admirers? says Joe...—The wife’s advisers, I mean, says Bloom...Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act.like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit.of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that.Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow.contested the mortgagee’s right till he near had the head of me addled.with his mortgagor under the act
O, commend me to an.israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery...So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he.was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and.to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was.never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that’s dead to tell her..Choking with bloody foolery
Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the.bobby, 14A
And calling himself a Frenchy for the.shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he.serving mass in Adam and Eve’s when he was young with his eyes shut,.who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and.smugging
Jack Mooney’s sister
Told him if he didn’t patch up the pot, Jesus,.he’d kick the shite out of him...So Terry brought the three pints...—Here, says Joe, doing the honours
Want a small.fortune to keep him in drinks...—Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe...—Friend of yours, says Alf...—Nannan? says Joe
P., the cattle traders...—Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of.all countries and the idol of his own...So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and.the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen.sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his.sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the.guaranteed remedy for timber tongue
Walking about with his book and pencil here’s my head.and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot.for giving lip to a grazier
Black Liz is our hen
Klook Klook Klook...—Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London.to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons...—Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see.him, as it happens...—Well, he’s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight...—That’s too bad, says Bloom
You’re sure?..—Nannan’s going too, says Joe
The answer to the.honourable member’s question is in the affirmative...Mr Orelli O’Reilly (Montenotte
Nat.): Have similar orders been issued.for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the.Phoenix park?..Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative...Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman’s famous.Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury.bench? (O! O!)..Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question...Mr Staylewit (Buncombe
Cheers.)..—There’s the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival
The man that got away James Stephens
I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a.straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: _Look at, Bloom..Do you see that straw? That’s a straw_
Declare to my aunt he’d talk.about it for an hour so he would and talk steady...A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian.O’Ciarnain’s_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_, under the auspices of._Sluagh na h-Eireann_, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the.importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and.ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race
The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of.our old tongue, Mr Joseph M’Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for.the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised.morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best.traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient.ages
Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses,.having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the.discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty.plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy.rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis’ evergreen verses.(happily too familiar to need recalling here) _A nation once again_ in.the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without.fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself
The Irish.Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were.heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only.our citizen can sing it

Quirke, etc., etc...—Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that.Keogh-Bennett match?..—No, says Joe...—I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf...—Who? Blazes? says Joe...And says Bloom:..—What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training.the eye...—Ay, Blazes, says Alf
We know what put.English gold in his pocket...—True for you, says Joe...And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the.blood, asking Alf:..—Now, don’t you think, Bergan?..—Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf
God,.he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made.him puke what he never ate...It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were.scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns..Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin’s pet lamb made up.for it by superlative skill in ringcraft
The referee twice.cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his.footwork a treat to watch
After a brisk exchange of courtesies during.which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from.his opponent’s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and.landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett’s stomach, flooring him.flat
Amid tense expectation the.Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett’s second Ole.Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared.victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the.ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight...—He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf
is the bright particular star, isn’t she? says Joe...—My wife? says Bloom
Dirty Dan the dodger’s son off.Island bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to.fight the Boers
The.gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed..The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms...And lo, there entered one of the clan of the O’Molloy’s, a comely hero.of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty’s counsel learned.in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of.Lambert...—Hello, Ned...—Hello, Alf...—Hello, Jack...—Hello, Joe...—God save you, says the citizen...—Save you kindly, says J

And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only.Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting.examined first...—Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing
The truth, the whole truth and.nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson...—Me? says Alf
J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an.indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law...—Ha ha, Alf, says Joe...—Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife...—Pity about her, says the citizen
Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney’s.moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal.Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street..And who was he, tell us? A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven.shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding.defiance to the world...—And moreover, says J
Gob, we won’t be let even do that much itself...—Well, good health, Jack, says Ned...—Good health, Ned, says J
J...—-There he is again, says Joe...—Where? says Alf...And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter.and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in.as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a.secondhand coffin...—How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe...—Remanded, says J
J...One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James.Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers.saying he’d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob

Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn’t clap him in the dock.the other day for suing poor little Gumley that’s minding stones, for.the corporation there near Butt bridge...And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:..—A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?.Ten, did you say?..—Yes, your worship
There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave.his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the.probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first.chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and.final testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of.the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus.Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another
And there sat with him the.high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of.the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen.and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of.Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the.tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte.and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and.true
And they shackled him hand and.foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge.against him for he was a malefactor...—Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland.filling the country with bugs...So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe,.telling him he needn’t trouble about that little matter till the first.but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford
And so Joe swore high.and holy by this and by that he’d do the devil and all...—Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have.repetition
That’s the whole secret...—Rely on me, says Joe...—Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland
We.want no more strangers in our house...—O, I’m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom
It’s just that.Keyes, you see...—Consider that done, says Joe...—Very kind of you, says Bloom...—The strangers, says the citizen
J...And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a.spider’s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling.after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite.and when...—A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that’s what’s the cause of all.our misfortunes...—And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the _Police Gazette_.with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint...—Give us a squint at her, says I...And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows.off of Corny Kelleher

Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off.of that one, what?..So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on.him as long as a late breakfast...—Well, says the citizen, what’s the latest from the scene of action?.What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide.about the Irish language?..O’Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the.puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of.that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient.city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there,.after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken.solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once.more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided.Gael...—It’s on the march, says the citizen
puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till.you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting.your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to.impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and.botheration and their colonies and their civilisation...—Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen
I was in Europe with Kevin.Egan of Paris
You wouldn’t see a trace of them or their language.anywhere in Europe except in a _cabinet d’aisance._..And says John Wyse:..—Full many a flower is born to blush unseen...And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:..—_Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!_..He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the.medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan _Lamh.Dearg Abu_, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty.valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster.silent as the deathless gods...—What’s up with you, says I to Lenehan
You look like a fellow that had.lost a bob and found a tanner...—Gold cup, says he...—Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry..._—Throwaway,_ says he, at twenty to one
And the rest.nowhere...—And Bass’s mare? says Terry...—Still running, says he
Boylan plunged two quid.on my tip _Sceptre_ for himself and a lady friend...—I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on _Zinfandel_ that Mr Flynn.gave me
Lord Howard de Walden’s...—Twenty to one, says Lenehan
Frailty, thy.name is _Sceptre._..So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was.anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his.luck with his mangy snout up
Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard...—Not there, my child, says he...—Keep your pecker up, says Joe
Where are our missing.twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost.tribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world!.And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax.and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our.tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our.Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk.and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite.convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world
Where are.the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the.Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian.purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen? Read Tacitus and.Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis
Wine, peltries, Connemara marble,.silver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today,.the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs.duties for the right to fish in our waters
What do the yellowjohns of.Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? And the beds.of the Barrow and Shannon they won’t deepen with millions of acres of.marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?..—As treeless as Portugal we’ll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland.with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land..Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast
Save the.trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of.Eire, O...—Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan...The fashionable international world attended _en masse_ this afternoon.at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief.ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine.Valley

The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce.Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same.tone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a.pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form.of heron feathers of paletinted coral
Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan.will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest...—And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen
We had our trade with.Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were.pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway...—And will again, says Joe...—And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the.citizen, clapping his thigh

As much as his bloody.life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled.multitude in Shanagolden where he daren’t show his nose with the Molly.Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the.holding of an evicted tenant...—Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse
What will you have?..—An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion...—Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up

The.unfortunate yahoos believe it...They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth,.and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast,.born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was.scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day.he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend.till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be.paid...—But, says Bloom, isn’t discipline the same everywhere
Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid.low by the batteringram and the _Times_ rubbed its hands and told the.whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as.redskins in America
But the.Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of.crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro
And they will come again and with a vengeance, no.cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan...—Perfectly true, says Bloom
Since the.poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at.Killala...—Ay, says John Wyse

Edward Guelph-Wettin!..—And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and.bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic.Majesty’s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his.jockeys rode
I will...—You? says Joe...—Beholden to you, Joe, says I
May your shadow never grow less...—Repeat that dose, says Joe...Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with.his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling.about...—Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it..Perpetuating national hatred among nations...—But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse...—Yes, says Bloom...—What is it? says John Wyse...—A nation? says Bloom
A nation is the same people living in the same.place...—By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that’s so I’m a nation for I’m.living in the same place for the past five years...So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to.muck out of it:..—Or also living in different places...—That covers my case, says Joe...—What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen...—Ireland, says Bloom
Ireland...The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and,.gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner...—After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to.swab himself dry...—Here you are, citizen, says Joe
Take that in your right hand and.repeat after me the following words...The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth.attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh,.authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and.called forth prolonged admiration
No need to dwell on the legendary.beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly.discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the.four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American.puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said.in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill

Which is which?..—That’s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman...—And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted..Also now
At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold.by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle...—Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen...—I’m talking about injustice, says Bloom...—Right, says John Wyse

More power,.citizen...—Hurrah, there, says Joe...—The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen...And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle...—We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket..What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women.and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text _God is love_.pasted round the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit.in the _United Irishman_ today about that Zulu chief that’s visiting.England?..—What’s that? says Joe...So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts.reading out:..—A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented.yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in.Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the.heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in.his dominions
The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of.which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely.translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod.Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the.cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire,.stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an.illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of.England’s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief.woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the.august hand of the Royal Donor
The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of.firstshot usquebaugh to the toast _Black and White_ from the skull of.his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty.Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and.signed his mark in the visitors’ book, subsequently executing a.charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed.several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands...—Widow woman, says Ned
And thereafter in that fruitful land.the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly...—Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse...—No, says the citizen
I met Bantam Lyons going to back.that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip..Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on
A dark horse...—He’s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe...—Mind, Joe, says I
Show us the entrance out...—There you are, says Terry...Goodbye Ireland I’m going to Gort
So I just went round the back of the.yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was.letting off my _(Throwaway_ twenty to) letting off my load gob says I.to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in.Slattery’s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings.is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was.telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have.done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she’s.better_ or _she’s_ (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool.if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!).Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody.(there’s the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos...So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it.was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper.all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off.of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk.about selling Irish industries
Robbing Peter to pay Paul
And his old fellow before.him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that.poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country.with his baubles and his penny diamonds
Gob, he’s like Lanty MacHale’s goat that’d go a piece of the.road with every one...—Well, it’s a fact, says John Wyse
And there’s the man now that’ll.tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham...Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power.with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the.collector general’s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the.registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the.country at the king’s expense...Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their.palfreys...—Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party..Saucy knave! To us!..So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice...Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard...—Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow...—Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked
The.king’s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my.house I warrant me...—Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty.trencherman by his aspect
A poor house and a bare.larder, quotha! ’Tis a merry rogue...So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom...—Where is he? says Lenehan
Defrauding widows and orphans...—Isn’t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen.about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?..—That’s so, says Martin
I’m the alligator...—And after all, says John Wyse, why can’t a jew love his country like.the next fellow?..—Why not? says J
Or who is he? No offence, Crofton...—Who is Junius? says J
J...—We don’t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian...—He’s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was.he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system
We know.that in the castle...—Isn’t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power...—Not at all, says Martin
And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe,.till he knows if he’s a father or a mother...—Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan...—O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his.that died was born
J...—Do you call that a man? says the citizen...—I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe...—Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power...—And who does he suspect? says the citizen...Gob, there’s many a true word spoken in jest
Cursed by God...—Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned...—Only one, says Martin
and S...—You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry...—Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us,.says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our.shores...—Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass
God bless all here is my.prayer...—Amen, says the citizen...—And I’m sure He will, says Joe...And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with.acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and.subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors.and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto,.Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and.Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines,.Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter.Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet.led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and.friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers,.minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of.Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks.of S

And as they wended their way.by Nelson’s Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little.Britain street chanting the introit in _Epiphania Domini_ which.beginneth _Surge, illuminare_ and thereafter most sweetly the gradual._Omnes_ which saith _de Saba venient_ they did divers wonders such as.casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes,.healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had.been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and.prophesying
And when the.good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard.Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale.grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for the sale of beer, wine.and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the.house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults.and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and.the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the.lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that.house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and.make the angels of His light to inhabit therein
And entering he.blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed.answered his prayers...—_Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini._..—_Qui fecit cœlum et terram._..—_Dominus vobiscum._..—_Et cum spiritu tuo._..And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he.prayed and they all with him prayed:..—_Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde.super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et.voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem.sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animæ tutelam Te auctore.percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum._..—And so say all of us, says Jack...—Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford...—Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson
It’s a.secret...And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl...—Bye bye all, says Martin...And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or.whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be.all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car...—Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey...The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop.the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off.forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard
Even so.did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters..And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark.clave the waves...But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the.citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the.dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and.candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little.Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him...—Let me alone, says he...And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls.out of him:..—Three cheers for Israel!..Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ’ sake.and don’t be making a public exhibition of yourself
Gob, it’d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it.would...And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and.Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and.Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews.and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him.to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a.patch over his eye starts singing _If the man in the moon was a jew,.jew, jew_ and a slut shouts out of her:..—Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!..And says he:..—Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza
Christ was a.jew like me...Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop...—By Jesus, says he, I’ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy.name...By Jesus, I’ll crucify him so I will
Give us that biscuitbox here...—Stop! Stop! says Joe...A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from.the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid.farewell to Nagyaságos uram Lipóti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander.Thom’s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for.the distant clime of Százharminczbrojúgulyás-Dugulás (Meadow of.Murmuring Waters)
An illuminated scroll.of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to.the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the.community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket,.tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work.which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob..The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of.those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of.Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _Come Back to Erin_,.followed immediately by _Rakóczsy’s March_
Tarbarrels and bonfires.were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the.Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains.of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the.Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of.M’Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom
Amid.cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a.big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills,.the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final.floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were.present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river,.escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and.Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical.power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.._Visszontlátásra, kedvés barátom! Visszontlátásra!_ Gone but not.forgotten...Gob, the devil wouldn’t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin.anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he.shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen’s.royal theatre:..—Where is he till I murder him?..And Ned and J
The.observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the.fifth grade of Mercalli’s scale, and there is no record extant of a.similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534,.the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas
The epicentre appears to.have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn’s Quay.ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres,.two roods and one square pole or perch
An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the.much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a.silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat.of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of.quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been.discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island.respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant’s.causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in.the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale

And there came a voice out of heaven, calling:._Elijah! Elijah!_ And He answered with a main cry: _Abba! Adonai!_ And.they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels.ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees.over Donohoe’s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel....[ 13 ]..The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious.embrace
Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of.all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud.promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on.the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on.the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the.stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a.beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea...The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening.scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly
Many a time and.oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy.chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy.Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and.Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits.with caps to match and the name _H
Belleisle_ printed on both..For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very.noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little.fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them
And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to.and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with.delight
Cissy.Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty.dimple in his chin...—Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said
I want a drink of.water...And baby prattled after her:..—A jink a jink a jawbo...Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of.children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could.never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that.held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown.bread with golden syrup on
None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort,.was Cissy Caffrey
And Edy Boardman.laughed too at the quaint language of little brother...But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and.Master Jacky
Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master.Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends...—Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively
Still the blue.eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed.away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and.said if she was near him she wouldn’t be far from him, her eyes dancing.in admonition...—Nasty bold Jacky! she cried...She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:..—What’s your name? Butter and cream?..—Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman
Is Cissy your.sweetheart?..—Nao, tearful Tommy said...—Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried...—Nao, Tommy said...—I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from.her shortsighted eyes
Gerty is.Tommy’s sweetheart...—Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears...Cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy.Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman.couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes...But who was Gerty?..Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought,.gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a.specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see
Her figure was slight and.graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had.been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the.Widow Welch’s female pills and she was much better of those discharges.she used to get and that tired feeling
Bertha Supple.told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black.out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their.little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told.her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or.she’d never speak to her again
There.was an innate refinement, a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which.was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep..Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in.her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education.Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the.land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow.and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their.devoirs to her
Then.there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase.your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose? That would.suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one
They were protestants in his family.and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed.Virgin and then Saint Joseph
But he was undeniably handsome with an.exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the.shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would.know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the.bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice.perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size.too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so.frightfully clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front.of her bit of a garden...Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of.Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be.out
Her shoes.were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she.was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a.five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one.smart buckle over her higharched instep
Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain..Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage.has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T..C
(because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs.Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was.wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox.was not to be
Impetuous fellow! Strength.of character had never been Reggy Wylie’s strong point and he who would.woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men
With all the heart of her she longs to be.his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in.health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward...And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was.just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his.little wife to be
Then they could talk about her till they went blue.in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she.would be twentytwo in November
Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue.and queen Ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden.opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a.fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same.direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of.eggs though she didn’t like the eating part when there were any people.that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn’t eat something.poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully.appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph.of grandpapa Giltrap’s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was.so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in.Clery’s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses
He would be.tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a.husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed.sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their.honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in.a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both.have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and.before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a.good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes...Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then.she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run.off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight
But Tommy.said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with.the ball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but Tommy said.it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if.you please
The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy.Caffrey since he was out of pinnies
Edy told him no, no and to be off.now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him...—You’re not my sister, naughty Tommy said
It’s my ball...But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her.finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand.and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day...—Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss...And she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played.here’s the lord mayor, here’s his two horses, here’s his gingerbread.carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper.chin
But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way.like that from everyone always petting him...—I’d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won’t.say...—On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily...Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy.saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her.life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was.sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said
It was the men’s temperance retreat.conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S
They were there.gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most.edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves,.after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the.immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her.to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin.of virgins
And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard.her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman.off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like.himself passing along the strand taking a short walk
Poor.father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me,.Mary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they.had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby’s salad dressing for supper.and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died.suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke
Her.mother’s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom.and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have.had a group taken
It was Gerty who turned off the gas.at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of.that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime.Mr Tunney the grocer’s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days.where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a.threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with.oldtime chivalry through her lattice window
Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries.and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it.to her please
The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then.threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the.slope and stopped right under Gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the.rock
The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it.away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she.wished their stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a.kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed...—If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said...Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip
Cissy Caffrey played with.baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air..Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was.Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my.word, didn’t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say.papa...—Say papa, baby
Wonderful eyes they were,.superbly expressive, but could you trust them? People were so queer..She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face.that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin.Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred.because she wasn’t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they.two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see.whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he.was sitting
She was glad that something told her to put on the.transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was.far away
Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the.stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue.banners of the blessed Virgin’s sodality and Father Conroy was helping.Canon O’Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes.cast down
She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip.up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a.lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece.whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just.because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see.all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as.possible
_Tableau!_.That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that.to witness...Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints,.they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy.handed the thurible to Canon O’Hanlon and he put in the incense and.censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and.she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she.didn’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a.bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking.that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O’Hanlon handed.the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the.Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she.just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to.the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_
Three and eleven she paid for those.stockings in Sparrow’s of George’s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday.before Easter and there wasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was.looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had.neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his.head to see the difference for himself...Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with.her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a.streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought.only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her.petticoat hanging like a caricature
Her woman’s instinct told her that.she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet.swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a.glorious rose...Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty,.half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the.baby
And when Cissy came up Edy.asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was.half past kissing time, time to kiss again
But Edy wanted to know.because they were told to be in early...—Wait, said Cissy, I’ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what’s the.time by his conundrum...So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his.hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his.watchchain, looking up at the church
His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in.measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones..Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said.his waterworks were out of order...Then they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O’Hanlon.got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he.told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire.to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and.she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the.works and she swung her leg more in and out in time
It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you.know it...Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty.noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect.because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place.to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied.their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O’Hanlon.stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed.him the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti.eis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and.asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just.answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she.heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over
As.for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck.him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as.much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a.dozen pieces
And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him.one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot..Miss puny little Edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty.could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a.towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft.had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was.something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and.never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it.so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it...Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked.in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because.the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior
And Cissy told.him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and.baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and.Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby,.without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and.sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib...—O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss
He has his bib destroyed...The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set.that little matter to rights...Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy.asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was.flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed.it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction.because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet.seashore because Canon O’Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that.Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the.Blessed Sacrament in his hands...How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse.of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time.a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither,.thither, with a tiny lost cry
And she could see far away the lights of.the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of.paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the.lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church.grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked.and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn.his freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss.Cummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales
She loved to read poetry and when she got a.keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the.coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of.her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was.scrupulously neat and clean
_Art thou real, my ideal?_ it was called by Louis J.Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt.thou ever?_ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient.loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the.years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one.shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an.accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it..But it must end, she felt
Come what might she would be.wild, untrammelled, free...Canon O’Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and.genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then.he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and.Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked.wasn’t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:..—O, look, Cissy!..And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over.the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple...—It’s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said...And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,.helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy.holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running...—Come on, Gerty, Cissy called
She leaned back far to look up where the.fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall.back looking up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she.revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply.soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his.heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of.men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead.secret and made her swear she’d never about the gentleman lodger that.was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had.pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and.she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine.sometimes in the bed
Besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t do.the other thing before being married and there ought to be women.priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy.Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes.so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors’.photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on.the way it did...And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned.back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent.and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was.and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something.queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark
Leopold Bloom (for it is.he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes..What a brute he had been! At it again? A fair unsullied soul had called.to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered? An utter cad he.had been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in.those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and.sinned and wandered
She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile,.a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted...Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy,.to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman
Just changes when you’re on the track of the secret..Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as then
Now won’t you? Molly and Josie Powell
Bold hand: Mrs Marion..Did I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent.to Flynn? And the day I went to Drimmie’s without a necktie

And when I sent her for Molly’s Paisley shawl to.Prescott’s by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her.stocking! Clever little minx
And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see.and Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the.rocks

The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death.the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was.died in Mona Island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas.and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his.undeathliness
There was a sort of scholars along either side.the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary.Merciable’s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of.medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa,.one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at.head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long.of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young.Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and.beside the meek sir Leopold
And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast.friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that.his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as.they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner
Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends..But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was.that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or.leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead..Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi’s praise of that.beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the.other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they.did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his.engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to.do
Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir.Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour.which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare.whoso she might be or wheresoever
Then spake young Stephen orgulous of.mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons,.of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of.brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius.saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or.an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu.secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of.Averroes and Moses Maimonides
Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he.averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he.was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that.taking it appeared eftsoons...But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had.pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and.as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only.manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art.could save so dark is destiny
And she was wondrous stricken of heart.for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of.lamb’s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and.lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir.Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him.his friend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness.and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for.all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure.for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and.murdered his goods with whores...About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty.so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed.their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying.for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge.the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray
No question but.her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer,.Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and.Bernardus saith aptly that She hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae.supplicem_, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is.the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other,.our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of.navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin..But here is the matter now
Or she knew him, that second I say, and was.but creature of her creature, _vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio_, or.she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy.with Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with.Joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages,._parceque M
With will will we withstand, withsay...Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would.sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod.of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack:._The first three months she was not well, Staboo,_ when here nurse.Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was.it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all.orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no.gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard
In Horne’s house rest should reign...To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in.Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he.had not cided to take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the.womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days
Thereat mirth grew in them the more.and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing.and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island,.she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain,.with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries.and the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was.there unmaided
He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those.delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is.in their _Maid’s Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers:._To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable.concent upon the virginals
Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed,.but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher.for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come
Remember, Erin, thy.generations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by.my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication.in my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum
And as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor.to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or.to Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see.from what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched.his whenceness...Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _Etienne chanson_ but he.loudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast.majestic longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all.in applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea..
He.drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it.thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden,.being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of.doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart’s side, spoke to him calming.words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing.but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the.thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a.natural phenomenon...But was young Boasthard’s fear vanquished by Calmer’s words? No, for he.had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be.done away
Then wotted.he nought of that other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the.land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for.ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering.at which all shall come as many as believe on it? Yes, Pious had told.him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason.was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing.exterior whose name, she said, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him.wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as,.Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave.place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot.which is named Two-in-the-Bush or, by some learned, Carnal.Concupiscence...This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of.Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore.Bird-in-the-Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a.wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and.know her
So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr.Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon,.Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer

In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and.will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and.water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi’s almanac (and I.hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out.of the Hindustanish for his farmer’s gazette) to have three things in.all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and.bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their.queerities no telling how...With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the.letter was in that night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about.him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but.on Stephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit.near by which he did mighty brisk
Faith, no, he.says, Frank (that was his name), ’tis all about Kerry cows that are to.be butchered along of the plague
_Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the.French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a.winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too
What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to.know the drift of it, will they slaughter all? I protest I saw them but.this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he
And he had experience of the like brood.beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been.some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster.that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr.Gavin Low’s yard in Prussia street
Mr Stephen, a little.moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had.dispatches from the emperor’s chief tailtickler thanking him for the.hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted.cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the.bull by the horns
But the slap and.the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he.taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess.and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the.month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the.nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young.ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland
And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got.scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a.husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or.a bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half the countryside rooting.up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry’s orders..There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the.lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an.old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I’ll meddle in.his matters, says he
But one evening, says.Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to.dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the.first rule of the course was that the others were to row with.pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and.on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he.found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous.champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for.boss of the show
After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his.head into a cow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers.and pulling it out again told them all his new name
They were, says Mr.Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was.toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft,.loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all.masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread.three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed.anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times.three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea.to recover the main of America
Which was the occasion, says Mr.Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty:.._—Pope Peter’s but a pissabed...A man’s a man for a’ that._..Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway.as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend.whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon,.who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a.cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars
Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards.which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell’s bearing a legend.printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan
His project, as he went on to expound, was.to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief.business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and.to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has.been framed
He proposed to set up there a national fertilising.farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the.fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the.fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there.direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her.natural
His project meanwhile was very favourably.entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr.Dixon of Mary’s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he.purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle
Mr Mulligan however made.court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as.it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of.his contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut.matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici.titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus.centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder.wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more.suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the.farmyard drake and duck...Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper.man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with.animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics.while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had.advanced
Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for.whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him.a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional.assistance we could give? Who, upon his offer, thanked him very.heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he.was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne’s house, that was.in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman’s woe (and here he.fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place
Mr.Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether.his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an.ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due,.as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the.stomach
For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls,.smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable.droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex.though ’tis pity she’s a trollop): There’s a belly that never bore a.bastard
Tut, tut! cries Le.Fécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most.accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in.a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape.Horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even.the stoutest cloak
Why, you’re as bad as dear.little Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half.choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way
Stap my vitals, said he, them was.always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most.particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand.to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks.back on with a loving heart...To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of.some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits.of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity..The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as.overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were.difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and.outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were.they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of.strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf
In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring.to urge, to mollify, to refrain
Every phase of the situation was.successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers,.the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that.rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as.the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr.Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused,.the rights of primogeniture and king’s bounty touching twins and.triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the.acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the.agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan).in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the.medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other.spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation.of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the.vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in.the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix,.artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb.consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the.species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that.distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers._Sturzgeburt,_ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and.monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of.consanguineous parents—in a word all the cases of human nativity which.Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic.illustrations
The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole,.supernumerary digits, negro’s inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain.were alleged by one as a _prima facie_ and natural hypothetical.explanation of those swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel Steevens.was not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born
It was effaced as easily as it had.been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of.pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as.the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man
Contemporaneously,.a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr.Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created.in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty.by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant.submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus

Do you not think it, Stephen? Theosophos.told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian.priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law
The lords of the.moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of.the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were.therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second.constellation...However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him.being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which.was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was.not the case at all

Must we accept the view of Empedocles of.Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert.others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long.neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is.it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper,.Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture.of both? This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature’s.favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on.the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus.felix_, of the passive element

Accordingly.after a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having.forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had.done yeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together.along Beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier’s and.the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of.Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence.debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin’s
But.as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for.hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some.fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was.no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was.anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by.emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head,.twice...This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently.there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it.which they accordingly did
So, bevelling around by Mullett’s and the.Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the.direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped.by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had,.to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though,.entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made.light of the mischance
So as neither of them were particularly pressed.for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it.cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they.dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a.fare or a jarvey
They passed the main entrance of the Great.Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of.course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the.backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say.gruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the.Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its.C division police station
Between this point and the high at present.unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen,.associated with Baird’s the stonecutter’s in his mind somehow in Talbot.place, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as.his _fidus Achates_ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of.James Rourke’s city bakery, situated quite close to where they were,.the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities.of the public the primary and most indispensable
Highly providential was the appearance on the.scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for.that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might.have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or,.failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day.before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant.to say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got.bruited about
The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those.policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in.the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or.two in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole.through a ten gallon pot
Most of all he.commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting._confrères_ but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his.brother medicos under all the circs...—And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing.whatsoever of any kind...Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back.of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a.brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one.attracted their rather lagging footsteps
To avoid a meeting he drew.nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge...—Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said...A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches.saluted again, calling:..—Night!..Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the.compliment
Though unusual in the Dublin area he.knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next.to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising.peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some.secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames.embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply.marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell.swoop at a moment’s notice, your money or your life, leaving you there.to point a moral, gagged and garrotted...Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters,.though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley’s.breath redolent of rotten cornjuice
Lord John Corley some called him.and his genealogy came about in this wise
He was the eldest son of.inspector Corley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married a.certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer
His.grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of.a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot..Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of.the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably.fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or.some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had.enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen
This.therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though.dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with.facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley...Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell..Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night’s lodgings
Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called.him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of.other uncalledfor expressions
Anyhow he was all in...—I wouldn’t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows.I’m on the rocks...—There’ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys’.school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher
Mr Garrett Deasy
I got stuck.twice in the junior at the christian brothers...—I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him...Corley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to.do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody.tart off the street
He was starving too though he.hadn’t said a word about it...Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it.still Stephen’s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he.knew that Corley’s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was.hardly deserving of much credence
Stephen anyhow lent him.one of them...—Thanks, Corley answered, you’re a gentleman
God, you’ve to book ahead, man, you’d think it was for the.Carl Rosa
I don’t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as.a crossing sweeper...Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six.he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky.that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam’s, the shipchandler’s,.bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle’s back with.O’Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe
Anyhow he.was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and.disorderly and refusing to go with the constable...Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the.cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation.watchman’s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him,.was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own.private account while Dublin slept
Pretty thick that was certainly...The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his.practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the.blandiloquence of the other parasite
Where does he live at present? I gathered in the course of.conversation that he had moved...—I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly..Why?..—A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects.than one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one
You could go back perhaps, he.hasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row.terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan,.that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred.their third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally.station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion,.which they did...There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it.was, Stephen’s mind’s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his.family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by.the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell.cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he.could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings.they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and.Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells.and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in.accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on.the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or.something like that...—No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn’t personally repose much trust.in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element,.Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your.shoes
But it wouldn’t occasion.me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic.was put in your drink for some ulterior object...He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a.versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was.rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified,.bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future.as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services.in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from.certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid.at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an.exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that.frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be.at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or.jealousy, pure and simple...—Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking.your brains, he ventured to throw out...The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by.friendliness which he gave at Stephen’s at present morose expression of.features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the.problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge.by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about.saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to.himself allowed matters to more or less
Mezzo sovrano più..._.._—Dice lui, però!_.._—Mezzo._.._—Farabutto! Mortacci sui!_.._—Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa più..._..Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman’s shelter, an unpretentious.wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been.before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few.hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat.Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual.facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in
Why do you not.write your poetry in that language? _Bella Poetria_! It is so melodious.and full
For.which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he.did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was.temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him...—Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time,.like names
Jesus, Mr Doyle..Shakespeares were as common as Murphies
Our name.was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across...The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded.Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely.by asking:..—And what might your name be?..Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion’s boot but.Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected.quarter, answered:..—Dedalus...The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes,.rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old.Hollands and water...—You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length...—I’ve heard of him, Stephen said...Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently.eavesdropping too...—He’s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same.way and nodding
All Irish...—All too Irish, Stephen rejoined...As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole.business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when.the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the.shelter with the remark:..—I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his.shoulder
Then.he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the.night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance...—Pom! he then shouted once...The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation,.there being still a further egg...—Pom! he shouted twice...Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding.bloodthirstily:.._—Buffalo Bill shoots to kill,..Never missed nor he never will._..A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness’ sake just felt like.asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the.Bisley...—Beg pardon, the sailor said...—Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth...—Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic.influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years
I seen him do that.in Stockholm...—Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively...—Murphy’s my name, the sailor continued
Murphy of Carrigaloe..Know where that is?..—Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied...—That’s right, the sailor said
Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle
She’s my own true wife I haven’t seen for seven years.now, sailing about...Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming.to the mariner’s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a.rainy night with a blind moon
Quite a.number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic,.Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember.Caoc O’Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way.of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way..Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the.absentee
And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the.publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and.onions
Murphy...The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one.of the jarvies with the request:..—You don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?..The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die.of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object.was passed from hand to hand...—Thank you, the sailor said...He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow.stammers, proceeded:..—We come up this morning eleven o’clock
I was in the Red Sea
I was in China and.North America and South America
I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea,.the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever.scuttled a ship
Glass...Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the.card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark
It ran.as follows: _Tarjeta Postal, Señor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago,.Chile._ There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice..Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the.eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the.Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which.occasion the former’s ball passed through the latter’s hat) having.detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he.represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after.having boxed the compass on the strict q.t
Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work.a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up.with the net result that the scheme fell through
But even suppose it.did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd’s heart it was.not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering.the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there.and back
The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone.and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose.liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route,.Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive.tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern.Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower,.abbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with
Brown, Robinson and Co...It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no.small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the.system really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry.pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead.of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took.me for a wife
After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more.humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the.grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at.her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life..There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home.island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora.of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around.Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there.was a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in.Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood.for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn’t come down, and in the wilds.of Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d’œil_ was exceedingly.grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that.the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering.the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic.associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O’Malley, George IV,.rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt.with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when.young men’s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off.the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their.left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour’s run from the.pillar
and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both.instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the.strictly _entre nous_ variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat,._alias_ the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid.from his boiler affair
Give us back them papers...The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape...—Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom inquired...The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or.no...—Ah, you’ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he.had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences.but he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the.sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn...—What year would that be about? Mr B interrogated
On more than one occasion, a dozen at.the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a.superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the.not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at.it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone.somewhere sings
Nevertheless, without going.into the _minutiae_ of the business, the eloquent fact remained that.the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things.somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence.though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that.sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery.and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for.that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable.institution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland.or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like.that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and.coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid.the elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that.every man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the.wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to.capsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had.experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather...—There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_, the old seadog,.himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as.gentleman’s valet at six quid a month
There’s my son now, Danny,.run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper’s in Cork where.he could be drawing easy money...—What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the.side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away.from the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy.getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage...—Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?.He’d be about eighteen now, way I figure it...The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow.shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was.to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent.an anchor...—There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts..I must get a wash tomorrow or next day
That was done when we were lying.becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton
And.there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his.fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn...And in point of fact the young man named Antonio’s livid face did.actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the.unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat, who this.time stretched over...—Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest
Round the side of the _Evening.Telegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side.of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was.not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of.gazers round skipper Murphy’s nautical chest and then there was no more.of her...—The gunboat, the keeper said...—It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking,.how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with.disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober.senses, if he values his health in the least
But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for.instance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison,.though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean,.and the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural.phenomenon such as electricity but it’s a horse of quite another colour.to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God...—O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several.of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial.evidence...On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they.were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference.in their respective ages, clashed...—Has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his.original point with a smile of unbelief
Try a bit...—Couldn’t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the.moment refusing to dictate further...Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir.or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with.something approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance.(and lucrative) work
On the other hand he had a distinct and painful.recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been.prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration.indeed for her pianoplaying
It reminds me of Roman history...Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated.article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly.Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was.the least conspicuous point about it...—Our mutual friend’s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom _apropos_ of.knives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_
There’s an example again of simple souls...However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who.reminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied the.boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the.management in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host.of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him.though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually.fell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically.incompatible about it, he conceded
On the contrary that stab in the.back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he.was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the.fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in.little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking.fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless.necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to.have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or.her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap...—Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like.that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own.hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they.carry in the abdomen
_Roberto ruba roba sua_...—Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed...—Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown.listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles.triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san.Tommaso Mastino...—It’s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once
He had doubled the cape a few odd times and.weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all.those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him.or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him...So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt’s rock, wreck.of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for.the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry.Campbell remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand
That was the talk.of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of.original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish._Times_), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore.in commotion petrified with horror
_Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_.which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with.all hands on deck
The irrepressible Bloom, who also had.a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the.counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared.to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when.duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and.girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was.all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved
Slightly.disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of.the corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking.up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now.practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin.in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before.shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again.in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its.most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and.familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a.cool £ 100 a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass.proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of
Right enough the harbours were there.only no ships ever called...There were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidently _au.fait_...What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only.rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr.Worthington or some name like that, eh? Ask the then captain, he.advised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that.day’s work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line...—Am I right, skipper? he queried of the sailor, now returning after his.private potation and the rest of his exertions...That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words.growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or.other in seconds or thirds
    O, Johnny Lever!
    Johnny Lever, O!..After which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene.and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form.provided
Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to.grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent.the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he.described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none.on the face of God’s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal.in large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every.year, ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained.out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through.the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot.more surplus steam in the same vein
The Boers were the beginning of the end..Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be.Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the.vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his auditors at.once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the.tendon referred to on his boot
His advice to every Irishman was: stay.in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland..Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons...Silence all round marked the termination of his _finale_
And as for the.lessee or keeper, who probably wasn’t the other person at all, he (B.).couldn’t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people.like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and.refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private.life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a.Dannyman coming forward and turning queen’s evidence or king’s now like.Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated
Quite apart from.that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle..Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his.bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it.(while inwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for.a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage.of his political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a.party to any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of.the south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently,.after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with.the other lucky mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted.fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative.postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just.struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for.the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was.reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of.fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on
So.similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid.of some £
in the course of his perambulations round the docks in.the congenial atmosphere of the _Old Ireland_ tavern, come back to Erin.and so on
Am I not right?..He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride.at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to.glean in a kind of a way that it wasn’t all exactly...—_Ex quibus_, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or.four eyes conversing, _Christus_ or Bloom his name is or after all any.other, _secundum carnem_...—Of course, Mr B
It’s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate.people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular,.in the next house so to speak...—Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes’ war, Stephen.assented, between Skinner’s alley and Ormond market...Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that.was overwhelmingly right
History, would.you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the.inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell,.an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer.for, imported them
Spain again, you saw in the war,.compared with goahead America
_Ubi patria_, as we learned a.smattering of in our classical days in _Alma Mater, vita bene_
What? You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn..Each is equally important...—You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may.be important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called.Ireland for short...—I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated...—But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important.because it belongs to me...—What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under.some misapprehension
And then the usual._dénouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed.into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a.strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so.as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law.amendment act, certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not.divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains..Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly.turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and.the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in.the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne,.then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high.personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state,.he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running.counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before.under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good.Mrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the.reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women.chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being.largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it

He changed his name to De Wet, the.Boer general
Of course nobody being acquainted.with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his.whereabouts which were decidedly of the _Alice, where art thou_ order.even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and.Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within.the bounds of possibility
He saw him once on the.auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the _Insuppressible_.or was it _United Ireland_, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in.point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he.said _Thank you_, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid.exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the.cup and the lip: what’s bred in the bone
Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and.Harry against
And then, number one, you came up against the man in.possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the.Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, _Bella_ was the boat’s name to.the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence.went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew.was it, as he might very easily have picked up the details from some.pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description.given, introduce himself with: _Excuse me, my name is So and So_ or.some such commonplace remark
North or south,.however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and.simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the.very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that.wouldn’t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting.every shred of decency to the winds...—Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to.Stephen, about blood and the sun
And, if I don’t greatly mistake she.was Spanish too...—The king of Spain’s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or.other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and.the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and.so many...—Was she? Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any.means, I never heard that rumour before
So, Spain...Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_, which reminded him.by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out.his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained.rapidly finally he...—Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded.photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?..Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large.sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she.was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously.low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than.vision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth,.standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which.was _In Old Madrid_, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all.the vogue
Her (the lady’s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about.to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland.street, Dublin’s premier photographic artist, being responsible for the.esthetic execution...—Mrs Bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom.indicated
Very like.her then...Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his.legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major.Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a.singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered.barely sweet sixteen
Yes, puritanisme, it.does though, Saint Joseph’s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne.toi trop
Suppose she was gone when he?.I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely.as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning.littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses.(_sic_) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately.beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray...The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated,._distingué_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of.the bunch though you wouldn’t think he had it in him yet you would..Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it.was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter
He, B,.enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin’s uncrowned king in the.flesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen.leader’s, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when.clothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader’s) trusty henchmen to the.number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated.into the printing works of the _Insuppressible_ or no it was _United.Ireland_ (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up.the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of.some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O’Brienite.scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile.tribune’s private morals
His hat (Parnell’s) a silk one was inadvertently.knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who.picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to.return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity).who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat.at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the.country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos.of the thing than anything else, what’s bred in the bone instilled into.him in infancy at his mother’s knee in the shape of knowing what good.form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and.thanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _Thank you, sir_, though in.a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal.profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the.course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after.the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory.after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave...On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes.of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing.immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the.wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case.for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate.husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter.from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the.crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms,.drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a.domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord.and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not.receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would.overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes.though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as.quite possibly there were several others
In the nature of single blessedness he would one day.take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the.interim ladies’ society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the.gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump.Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular.lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as.to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl.courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to.their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of.complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers’ ways and.flowers and chocs
The.queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who.was several years the other’s senior or like his father but something.substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made.on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty.Dumpty boiled...—At what o’clock did you dine? he questioned of the slim form and tired.though unwrinkled face...—Some time yesterday, Stephen said...—Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow.Friday
Ah, you mean it’s after twelve!..—The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself...Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected..Though they didn’t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there.somehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the.one train of thought
At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some.score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to.parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in.retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a.sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas
For instance when the.evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely.in people’s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a.copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which.wouldn’t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all.events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the.trend of modern opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his.mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted.with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he.at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he.strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion.by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan’s so that.he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of.mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him.(metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics.themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties.invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity.and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on.fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word...Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it.was, it was high time to be retiring for the night
A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the.grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn’t.appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly.beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger’s bawdyhouse.of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would.be the best clue to that equivocal character’s whereabouts for a few.days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids’) with.sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to.freeze the marrow of anybody’s bones and mauling their largesized.charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment.of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for.as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as.Mr Algebra remarks _passim_
I’ll.just pay this lot...The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain.sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the.keeper of the shanty who didn’t seem to...—Yes, that’s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of.that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less...All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (B’s) busy brain,.education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits,.up to date billing, concert tours in English watering resorts packed.with hydros and seaside theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian.with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other.things, no necessity, of course, to tell the world and his wife from.the housetops about it, and a slice of luck
Because he more than suspected he had his father’s voice to.bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be.just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the.direction of that particular red herring just to...The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former.viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers’ association.dinner in London somewhere
To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered.why...—Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner.put in, manifesting some natural impatience...—And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed...The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles.which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears...—Are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the townclerk.queried...—Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a.bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen.portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading..Sand in the Red Sea done that
_The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my.favourite and _Red as a Rose is She._..Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what,.found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a.hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which.time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied.loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched.him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were.sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions,.that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial.remark...To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first.to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first.and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for.the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine.host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were.not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a.grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four.coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously.spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him.in unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly well.worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark...—Come, he counselled to close the _séance_...Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the.shelter or shanty together and the _élite_ society of oilskin and.company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their._dolce far niente_
To which impromptu the.neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment’s hesitation, saying.straight off:..—To sweep the floor in the morning...So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same.time apologetic to get on his companion’s right, a habit of his, by the.bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles
The.night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit.weak on his pins...—It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a.moment
Lean on me...Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen’s right and led him on.accordingly...—Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange.kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and.all that...Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc
Wagnerian music, though.confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to.follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante’s _Huguenots_,.Meyerbeer’s _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart’s _Twelfth Mass_.he simply revelled in, the _Gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the.acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else.into a cocked hat
He also yielded to none in his admiration of.Rossini’s _Stabat Mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers,.in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable.sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and.putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers’ church.in upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the.doors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather
On the whole though favouring.preferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_,.a gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface.knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn
And.talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old.favourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel’s air in _Martha,.M’appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be.more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from.the lips of Stephen’s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of.the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat..Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn’t sing it but.launched out into praises of Shakespeare’s songs, at least of in or.about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near.Gerard the herbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus_, an.instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch,.whom B
did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded.familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _dux_.and _comes_ conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he.said, in the Queen’s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one.Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull...On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond.the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground,.brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not.perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to.sixtyfive guineas and John Bull
He inquired if it was John Bull the.political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical.names, as a striking coincidence...By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving,.Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other’s.sleeve gently, jocosely remarking:..—Our lives are in peril tonight
But.even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan’s, of the.same size, would be a holy horror to face
These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field.occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen’s words while the.ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly.interesting old...—What’s this I was saying? Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging _in.medias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your.acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind...He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen,.image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome.blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after.as he was perhaps not that way built...Still, supposing he had his father’s gift as he more than suspected, it.opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall’s Irish.industries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in.general...Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air _Youth here has.End_ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows.come from
Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_.about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men,.which boggled Bloom a bit:.
    Von der Sirenen Listigkeit
Bloom, nodding,.said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which.he did...A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons,.which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could.easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice.production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the.bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and.procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrée_ into.fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial.magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his.university degree of B
Besides, though.taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that,.different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue.as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin’s musical world after the.usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public.by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus omne_
And later on at a propitious opportunity he.purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on.the _fools step in where angels_ principle, advising him to sever his.connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was.prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious.pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call.it which in Bloom’s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side.of a person’s character, no pun intended...The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted.and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting.fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three.smoking globes of turds
And humanely his driver waited till he (or she).had ended, patient in his scythed car...Side by side Bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with Stephen passed.through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping.over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower,.Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad..
    Und alle Schiffe brücken...The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely.watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black,.one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by.Father Maher_
As they walked they at times stopped and walked again.continuing their _tête à tête_ (which, of course, he was utterly out.of) about sirens, enemies of man’s reason, mingled with a number of.other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the.kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in.the sleeper car who in any case couldn’t possibly hear because they.were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner.street _and looked after their lowbacked car_....[ 17 ]..What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?..Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they.followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and.Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left,.Gardiner’s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of.Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt,.bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place..Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the.circus before George’s church diametrically, the chord in any circle.being less than the arc which it subtends...Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?..Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman,.prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and.glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed.corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church,.ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers,.the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the.presabbath, Stephen’s collapse...Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their.respective like and unlike reactions to experience?..Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to.plastic or pictorial
Both admitted the.alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual.magnetism...Were their views on some points divergent?..Stephen dissented openly from Bloom’s views on the importance of.dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen’s.views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature..Bloom assented covertly to Stephen’s rectification of the anachronism.involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to.christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus,.son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign.of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt.(† 266 A.D.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty.and interred at Rossnaree
The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric.inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of.adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and.the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen.attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both.from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first.no bigger than a woman’s hand...Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?..The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining.paraheliotropic trees...Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in.the past?..In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public.thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard’s corner and.Leonard’s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield.avenue
In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the.wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of.Uppercross
In 1888 frequently with major.Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and.separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon’s house in Roundtown
Once.in 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both.occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom’s) house in Lombard street,.west...What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885,.1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at.their destination?..He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual.development and experience was regressively accompanied by a.restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations...As in what ways?..From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received:.existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from.existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived...What act did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?..At the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers,.number 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back.pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey...Was it there?..It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on.the day but one preceding...Why was he doubly irritated?..Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded.himself twice not to forget...What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly.(respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?..To enter or not to enter
Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the.area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at.the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its.length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten.inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in.space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in.preparation for the impact of the fall...Did he fall?..By his body’s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in.avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for.periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman,.pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast.of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year.one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era.five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand.three hundred and twentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle 9,.dominical letters C B, Roman indiction 2, Julian period 6617, MCMIV...Did he rise uninjured by concussion?..Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by.the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force.at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied.at its fulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the.subadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free.inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame.which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit.finally a portable candle...What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?..Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent.kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a.candle of 1 CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man.leaving the kitchen holding a candle...Did the man reappear elsewhere?..After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible.through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the.halldoor
In the open.space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his.candle...Did Stephen obey his sign?..Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and.followed softly along the hallway the man’s back and listed feet and.lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and.carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the.kitchen of Bloom’s house...What did Bloom do?..He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its.flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for.Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when.necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid.resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons.of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs.Flower and M’Donald of 14 D’Olier street, kindled it at three.projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby.releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its.carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen.of the air...Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?..Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two,.had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the.college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the.county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room.of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of.his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss.Julia Morkan at 15 Usher’s Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie.(Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62 Clanbrassil.street: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of.number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of.Saint Francis Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the.physics’ theatre of university College, 16 Stephen’s Green, north: of.his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father’s house in Cabra...What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from.the fire towards the opposite wall?..Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope,.stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the.chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs.folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of.ladies’ grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual.position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer.extremities and the third at their point of junction...What did Bloom see on the range?..On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left.(larger) hob a black iron kettle...What did Bloom do at the range?..He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron.kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to.let it flow...Did it flow?..Yes

E., on the instructions of.the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for.purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of.recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals.as in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding.their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch.meter, had

watercourses falling.from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic,.photophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the.globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90.% of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine.% marshes,.pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning.moon...Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he.return to the stillflowing tap?..To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of.Barrington’s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought.thirteen hours

That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the.known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the.suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and.of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in.space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as.a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present.existence...Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?..Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the.delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection.invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the.satellite of their planet...Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological.influences upon sublunary disasters?..It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the.nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to.verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the.sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity...What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and.woman?..Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian.generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her.luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and.setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced.invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to.inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent.waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to.render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil.inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant.implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm:.the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the.admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour,.when visible: her attraction, when invisible...What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom’s, who attracted Stephen’s,.gaze?..In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom’s) house the light of a.paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller.blind supplied by Frank O’Hara, window blind, curtain pole and.revolving shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street...How did he elucidate the mystery of an

trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations.were dissimilar: Bloom’s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form.of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate.year at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of.greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the.institution, 210 scholars: Stephen’s higher, more sibilant, who in the.ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic.consumption an insistent vesical pressure...What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the.invisible audible collateral organ of the other?..To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity,.reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity...To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus.circumcised (1 January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain.from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine.prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic.church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of.the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine.excrescences as hair and toenails...What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?..A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament.from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the.Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo...How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal.departer?..By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an.unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and.turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its.staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and.revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress...How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?..Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its.base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and.forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles...What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of.their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?..The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the.bells in the church of Saint George...What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?..By Stephen:.

as ask to get his.breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel when.he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his.highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan.that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing.all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was.actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all.her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and.earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God.help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and.lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was.pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like.her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a.welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here.and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her.dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats.especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that.and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always.if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much.better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I.suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have.a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till.they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as.much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre.sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was.O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he.sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day.I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones.she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into.a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying.on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more.like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same.besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor.paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I.was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it.not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by.his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her.so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was.really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it.planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember.Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he.not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and.turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what.harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to.him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever.met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle.in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in.with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as.I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a.letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the.paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the.blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably.that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all.men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is.now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old.fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I.care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though.Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my.nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace.padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell.of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by.getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat.without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was.drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of.course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table.on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing.my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see her aunt if.you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on.with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you.have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters.but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be.alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I.found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a.little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave.her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do.out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out.the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I.couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar.and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the.place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because.he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere.and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan.gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there.steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb.to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he.has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out.and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the.satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be.always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking.boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id.confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my.garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I.know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging.drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this.that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would.because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in.the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a.stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and.he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he.is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it.tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine.Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what.he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply.ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it.till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your.lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the.world about it people make its only the first time after that its just.the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man.without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when.you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish.some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in.his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul.almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to.Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and.I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my.child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where.you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done.with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put.it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he.want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat.hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he.Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in.the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never.turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost.for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them.Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense.off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre.married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the.pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt.like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though.I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of.his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it.who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of.drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they.stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking.green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with.the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American.that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do.to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took.the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt.lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I.popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful.to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when.I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in.Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and.tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing.about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that.evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it.brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to.church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only.grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I.lit the lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that.tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or.whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is.not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my.hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a.thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think.a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life.felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must.have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with.a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into.you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious.look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a.tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on.me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt.washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice.invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if.someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went.through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina.Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up.with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a.smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like.a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the.last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and.bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied.till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what.supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was.married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has.more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting.Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him.off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I.know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing.and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming.and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not.liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over.politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a.carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive.about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for.I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he.annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot.of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often.wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family.physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was.crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with.her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever.he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me.the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that.finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I.know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out.to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know.plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch.him with my veil and gloves on going out 1 kiss then would send them.all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of.course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him.that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love.him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might.imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of.a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it.out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and.wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the.night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I.want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper.with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too.much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know.more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie.whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I.said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash.possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick.when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the.indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what.spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at.that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was.too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged.afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of.laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling.out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great.humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it.meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us.not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault.she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes.got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her.face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she.must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment.she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk.about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes.he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him.just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might.murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes.mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when.he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he.always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and.now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ 10000 for a postcard.U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff.to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what.could you make of a man like that Id rather die 20 times over than.marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like.me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and.he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick.that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man.yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and.do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating.drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask.us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because.they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off.flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say.its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have.been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being.hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do.besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they..theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he.noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C.with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both.ordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his.two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it.was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed.breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting.all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long.one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got.after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish.times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to.Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the.turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea.2 days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him.because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he.meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that.if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill.stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still.I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of.a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to.mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my.stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another.time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I.could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world.that I what did he say I could give 9 points in 10 to Katty Lanner and.beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because.the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in.the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere.I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell.DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on.the choir stairs after I sang Gounods _Ave Maria_ what are we waiting.for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown.part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was.always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his.mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a.place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him.about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there.and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it.or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an.idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got.me so cheap as he did he was 10 times worse himself anyhow begging me.to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming.along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had.to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape.of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me.when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject.of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced.things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels.even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one.in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see.every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain.I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the.Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the.Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking.slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they.can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on.it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were.you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me.his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it.was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he.pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he.said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an.excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time.till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his.waistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look a big fool dreeping in.the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them.and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the.sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet.if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you.never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it.if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers.outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him.from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he.circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do.everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting.all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the.butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me.that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to.any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we.met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw.I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was.always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky.man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake.dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it.used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in.Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children.seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice.a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman.when he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote.the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it.simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to.embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the.same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you.think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the.door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface.Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after.dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me.professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in.his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out.you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I.thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches.first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was.trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he.must have been a bit late because it was 1/4 after 3 when I saw the 2.Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch.he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after.when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty.when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even.put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week.were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers.anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms.at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new.bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next.room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the.wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all.very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we.never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes.going where he is besides something always happens with him the time.going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for.the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with.the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and.the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion.for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two.gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was.too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a.good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd.have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him.O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I.wonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the.train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots.of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly.be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone.in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something.about him 1 or 2 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the.window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what.would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last.concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall.Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen.Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my.singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts.when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him.managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to.sing in the _Stabat Mater_ by going around saying he was putting Lead.Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out.he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some.old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein.lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and.nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very.intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats.all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I.hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and.Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd.East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and.just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was.lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty.he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the.road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could.have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of.the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of.dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their.fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love.to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish.cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from.Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham.battles on the 15 acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the.march past the 10th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O.the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made.his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me.a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen.up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like.I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going.round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave.this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the.knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or.tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go.and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money.and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I.could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when.I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the.expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with.his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat.always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from.behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the.dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so.quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the.way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish.tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly.welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he.was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the.stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20.quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for.me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that.sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming.back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor.looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first.noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I.wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my.fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for.I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers.were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have.slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always.hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down.your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a.great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case.if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one.thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I.think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them.either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she.didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of.silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought.them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one.change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into.him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id.want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips.he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a.delightful figure line 11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance.across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill.have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it.the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his.money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a.cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret.that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die.of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that.antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the.fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats.all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was.the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like.new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place.and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to.him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to.wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax.and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the.skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger.after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry.handkerchiefs about 6/- in all sure you cant get on in this world.without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it.around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea.into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues.itself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all.the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners.3 whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the.other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because.they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every.day for the 4 years more I have of life up to 35 no Im what am I at all.Ill be 33 in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith.shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys.on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down.to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham.street 1st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it.as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the.day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of.Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads.only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black.mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny.story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster.knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and.the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing.like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master.Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her.ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and.her a—e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that.pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody.can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that.twice I remember when I came to page 50 the part about where she hangs.him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a.woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out.of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the.crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have.a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of.her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and.she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar.the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted.the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me.too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to.chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it.and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank.where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day.of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with.him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe.like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching.about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still.only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could.have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada.once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly.Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I.lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming.into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no.good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as.I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot.of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me.altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and.cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I.went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes.take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles.off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my.backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in.Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as.insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were.giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of.her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second.time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see.him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for.me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs.Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him.being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled.I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely.sorry and Im sure you were..yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he.made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one.anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep.that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out.for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2.the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up.there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide.it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a.man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down.out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it.with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat.market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the.statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was.pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one.side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved.them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed.outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to.try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was 1 of the 7.wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night.coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade.to make you feel nice and watery I went into 1 of them it was so biting.cold I couldnt keep it when was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was.a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see.me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it.before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not.afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the.woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for.a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the.job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee.palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes.only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish.photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her.and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some.jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply.the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of.the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his.teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent.they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly.enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a.pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate.looking student that stopped in no 28 with the Citrons Penrose nearly.caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to.my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till.he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get.him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker.than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond.everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only.could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it.the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an.hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant.I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those.men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch.myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come.again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when.he made me spend the 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was.coming for about 5 minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him.after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or.anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain.who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man.theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice.about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my.eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue.between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday.two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday..frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those.engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and.out of them all sides like the end of Loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor.men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in.those roasting engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half.of those old Freemans and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying.about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the W.C I’ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there.for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres.last Januarys paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the.hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and.refreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get.like Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on.black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big.giant compared with their 3 Rock mountain they think is so great with.the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and.the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time.weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mrs.Stanhope sent me from the B Marche paris what a shame my dearest.Doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her other name.was just a p c to tell you I sent the little present have just had a.jolly warm bath and feel a very clean dog now enjoyed it wogger she.called him wogger wd give anything to be back in Gib and hear you sing.Waiting and in old Madrid

Grove with love yrs affly Hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit.married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was.awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to.step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was.given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them.expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic.all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or.jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious.old Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the 2.things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the.women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole.insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all.my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking.in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose.theyre dead long ago the 2 of them its like all through a mist makes.you feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all to.myself then a girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker.than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when I put it up.and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we.were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in.her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning.with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an.opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father.and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the.windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like.all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at.myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was.attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent.looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the.shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the.excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been.nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me.the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East.Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by.that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as.he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave.me by Mrs Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a.Molly in them

one.decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and.his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my.shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the.chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on.the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them.at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago.it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her.address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were.always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and.the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those.Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything.he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was.blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I.did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a.Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage.made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it.got as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run.away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or.aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me.waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and.booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing.everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when.general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great.fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there.from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the.son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums.rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with.messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their.jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men.to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the.gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about.Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum.lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil.with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his.nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner.but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room.on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky.talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along.I suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a.letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with.bits of paper in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails.listening to that old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an.instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your.hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me.looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the.opposite house that medical in Holles street

like to know grey matter they have it all in.their tail if you ask me those country gougers up in the City Arms.intelligence they had a damn sight less than the bulls and cows they.were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to.swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of.paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a.poor man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques or some.advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him addressed dear Madam.only his letter and the card from Milly this morning see she wrote

at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin.to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her.in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her.appearance ugly as she was near 80 or a 100 her face a mass of wrinkles.with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the.Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack.flying with all her carabineros because 4 drunken English sailors took.all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough.in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there.was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black.blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on.Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell.bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an.admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him.up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window.then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making.an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it.up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill.instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps.singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the.old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under.the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what.kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was.sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way.what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish.nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to.be married to him in 3 years time theres many a true word spoken in.jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about.myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I.suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all.the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and.the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the.black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it.was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in.the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the.rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all.about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail.careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was.a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and.throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that.white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could.without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was.tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be.the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those.frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever.they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots.Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when.they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing.yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever.he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I.was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness.out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last.day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he.wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was.awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me.with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop.even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was.afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once.took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered.with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of.youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with.you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling.there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I.pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I.opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I.had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first.tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt.awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the.same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got.over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back.the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the.middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was.his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was.rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to

him block me now.flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly 20.years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put.his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young.still about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is.quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has.she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever.dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you.might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I.was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in.from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and.pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle.hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to.read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he.hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he.always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso.swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long.preach about womans higher functions about girls now

Briggs does brig or those awful names with.bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I.wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my.mother whoever she

weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow.for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that.Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on.you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me.that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south.Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they.were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it.like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure 18 carrot gold.because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place

into a boat with him after.him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked.could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it.came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all.down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the.tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping.out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of.course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his.flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all.the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was.black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed.chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City.Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he.wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was.no love lost between us thats 1 consolation I wonder what kind is that.book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other.Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with.his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white.shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather.all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell.of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan.bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the.fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa.and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to.climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago.besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at.night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of.salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was.going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or.Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the.way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he.was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely.places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the.gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of.and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was.going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry.my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the.plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old.beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and.put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of.that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news 20 years in.jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine.his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles.away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows.to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a.madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute.like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed.Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better.than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and.he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was.looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits.making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit.there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling.especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl.down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather.instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not.like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the.same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way.he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the.place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming.in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as.I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then.doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to.look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack.statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got.that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for 2.shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right.not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at.the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to.understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant.say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and.helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its.me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on.the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now.shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me.whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly.come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her.round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well.he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to.go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I.smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I.sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I.tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a.parting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out.no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your.blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle.blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on.show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at.her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you.then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the.Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me.afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that.touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always.trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for.Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed.like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me.there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to.get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same.little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but.he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the.Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance.on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands.swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything.deep yet I never came properly till I was what 22 or so it went into.the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that.Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with.sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he.looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and.supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man.gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a.few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it.really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love.in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each.other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit.foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and.poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes.always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to.put her hair up at 15 my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time.enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes.pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too.but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a.fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we.met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to.see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough.till I gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that.now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me.that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because.how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night.before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to.leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as.she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was.the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself.they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the.two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever.going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming.Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that.old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the.things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course.shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly.dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something.and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends.to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you.please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father.such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the.cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at.the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won.them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody.saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand.funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody.hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head.I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been.hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the.ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was.something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and.now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband.getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they.have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats.her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres.some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead.in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if.Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt.that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he.had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that.pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows.theres always something wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4 weeks usual.monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like.that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him.to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about.insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt.give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his.glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul.thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could.all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it.out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry.supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery.hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a.woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up.for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is.better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience.above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me.pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just.put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn.it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a.virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you.could be a widow or divorced 40 times over a daub of red ink would do.or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this.pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what.between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too.jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the.other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor.with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think.it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I.might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next.time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face.wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me.after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I.made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse.and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be.he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits.easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling.like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for.a wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning.dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look.how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit.here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get.up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey.lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore..who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I.something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when.was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about 3 weeks I ought to go to.the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that.white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick.Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called.it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting.round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every.little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of.course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last.man in the world besides theres something queer about their children.always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what.I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one.thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly.old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and.could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the.rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by.the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I.can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and.needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by.Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the.same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and.asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all.the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked.sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows.what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out.frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you.lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever.enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad.crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious.Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and.of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he.had me always at myself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and I said I.hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him.up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited.me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in.Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about 10 minutes.as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking.after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half.sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand.for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his.blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool.of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O.beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and.rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy.anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st.opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom.pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk.and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I.laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight.sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so.that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose.there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at.the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard.bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth.breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to.show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a.pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out.that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put.together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody.I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big.square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway.wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt.creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere.still she must have given him great value for his money of course he.has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll.have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God.help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always.reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often.enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to.admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like.my bed God here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many houses.were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard.street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on.the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the.men with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse.and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always.somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always.know who was in there last every time were just getting on right.something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr.Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his

awfully.becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at.the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he.borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and.squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a.wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough.that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the.preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and.Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the.second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly.sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying.too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had.a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart._sweet_heart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet _tart_.goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in.it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we.sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even.transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed.say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I.wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a.university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he.driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have.got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look.young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and.me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge.station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats 11 years ago.now yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into mourning for.what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for.me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted.hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time.he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord.Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw.him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God.yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out.the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met.before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either.besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after.that the 10 of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on.its way and scandals too the 3 queens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise.in society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look.at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about.poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or.standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only.getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry.when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not.an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I.wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly is 15.yesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 88 I suppose.hes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 I hope hes not.that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting.down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of.course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was.out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not.a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson.they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont.find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where.poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully.coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point.the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back.there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that.for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly.bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young.star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to.talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts.ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in.their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like.to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young.those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace.from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or.something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men.like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely.little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and.his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and.poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his.lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth.if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and.white he looks with his boyish face I would too in 1/2 a minute even if.some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no.danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I.suppose never dream of washing it from 1 years end to the other the.most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure.itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age.Ill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard.comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out.Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew.who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the.same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him.till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and.mistress publicly too with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he.becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though..no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no.nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because.I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a.cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place.pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so.barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar.way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a.butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course.hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might.as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something.better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its.because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he.couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the.amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white.for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with.that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so.soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those.cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has.a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it.didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts.his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be.you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick.and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl.for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street.no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me.up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands.jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling.her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if.he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he.going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course.the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either.its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all.those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can.I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with.him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the.wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a.womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything.unnatural where we havent 1 atom of any kind of expression in us all of.us the same 2 lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the.dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita.theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a.madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a.woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look young.no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the.fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking.would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd.know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not.care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of.those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near.the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only.sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back.over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow.with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me.up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do.themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up.somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us.the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course.it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and.when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after.coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his.wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten.again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the.love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well.he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he.knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to.sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for.Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around.down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled.up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like.to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I.dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be.governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one.another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around.drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on.horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop.sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know.what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they.all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I.never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away.from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the.usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a.fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to.make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two.dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that.disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in.that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some.poor child but I knew well Id never have another our 1st death too it.was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into.the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I.felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of.roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and.pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining.himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to.love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends.they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some.woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder.they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I.suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like.that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I.suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the.next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I.wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had.the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave.me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and.Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown.myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the.bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and.Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am.a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day.older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish.como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all.I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person.place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs.Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the.two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the.Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant.what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and.wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in.bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad.luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and.something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might.like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the.criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you.see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself.not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend.we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is.dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head.sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres.the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his.writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he.does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes.making the breakfast for 1 he can make it for 2 Im sure Im not going to.take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house.like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated.person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with.the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown.that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long.ago in Walpoles only 8/6 or 18/6 Ill just give him one more chance Ill.get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I.might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and.tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in.lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st man Id meet theyre out.looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the.night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt.in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw.him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his.mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do.Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa.pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son.piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good.eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if.thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked.too up to my neck nearly not by him 5 or 6 times handrunning theres the.mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it.out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly.unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell.him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right.its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery.said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of.tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I.suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt.have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to.kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his.face as large as life he can stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole as hes.there my brown part then Ill tell him I want £ 1 or perhaps 30/- Ill.tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he.wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women.do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write.his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it.up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided.he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill.do the indifferent 1 or 2 questions Ill know by the answers when hes.like that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill.tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick.my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest.about yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and.friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing.pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of.plum and apple no Ill have to wear the old things so much the better.itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there.thats good enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me.just like a business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up.at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only.way a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just.getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well.soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil.their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the.alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself.let me see if I can doze off 1 2 3 4 5 what kind of flowers are those.they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much.nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it.twice better lower this lamp and try again so as I can get up early Ill.go to Lambes there beside Findlaters and get them to send us some.flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow.today I mean no no Fridays an unlucky day first I want to do the place.up someway the dust grows in it I think while Im asleep then we can.have music and cigarettes I can accompany him first I must clean the.keys of the piano with milk whatll I wear shall I wear a white rose or.those fairy cakes in Liptons I love the smell of a rich big shop at 7.1/2d a lb or the other ones with the cherries in them and the pinky.sugar 11d a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the.table Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them not long ago I.love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of.heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and.the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats.and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about.that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all.sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the.ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no.God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why.dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or.whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves.first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why.because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes.I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there.was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so.there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising.tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the.rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat.the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of.seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes 16 years ago.my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a.flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that.was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today.yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a.woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the.pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I.wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was.thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and.Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all.birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the.pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing.round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls.laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the.morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who.else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market.all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half.asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the.steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle.thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and.turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop.and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice.hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night.and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the.watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown.torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the.glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all.the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and.the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and.Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put.the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a.red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well.as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again.yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and.first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could.feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and.yes I said yes I will Yes...Trieste-Zurich-Paris..1914-1921........End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Ulysses, by James Joyce..*** END OF THIS

DENT & SONS LTD...Aldine House--Bedford St.--London..1885.....Introduction By Havelock Ellis...'GERMINAL' was published in 1885, after occupying Zola during the.previous year
For six months he travelled about.the coal-mining district in northern France and Belgium, especially.the Borinage around Mons, note-book in hand
'He was inquisitive, was.that gentleman', miner told Sherard who visited the neighbourhood at a.later period and found that the miners in every village knew _Germinal_..That was a tribute of admiration the book deserved, but it was never.one of Zola's most popular novels; it was neither amusing enough nor.outrageous enough to attract the multitude...Yet _Germinal_ occupies a place among Zola's works which is constantly.becoming more assured, so that to some critics it even begins to seem.the only book of his that in the end may survive
Thus.Faguet, who was the recognized academic critic of the end of the last.century, while he held that posterity would be unable to understand how.Zola could ever have been popular, yet recognized him as in Germinal.the heroic representative of democracy, incomparable in his power of.describing crowds, and he realized how marvellous is the conclusion of.this book...To-day, when critics view Zola In the main with indifference rather.than with horror, although he still retains his popular favour, the.distinction of _Germinal_ is yet more clearly recognized
Seillière,.while regarding the capitalistic conditions presented as now of an.ancient and almost extinct type, yet sees _Germinal_ standing out as.'the poem of social mysticism', while André Gide, a completely modern.critic who has left a deep mark on the present generation, observes.somewhere that it may nowadays cause surprise that he should refer with.admiration to _Germinal_, but it is a masterly book that fills him with.astonishment; he can hardly believe that it was written in French and.still less that it should have been written in any other language; it.seems that it should have been created in some international tongue...The high place thus claimed for _Germinal_ will hardly seem exaggerated..The book was produced when Zola had at length achieved the full mastery.of his art and before his hand had, as in his latest novels, begun to.lose its firm grasp
I will not here discuss Zola's literary.art (I have done so in my book of _Affirmations_); it is enough to say.that, though he was not a great master of style, Zola never again wrote.so finely as here...A word may be added to explain how this translation fell to the lot of.one whose work has been in other fields
It is, moreover, a satisfaction to me to know that I have.been responsible, however inadequately, for the only complete English.version of this wonderful book, 'a great fresco,' as Zola himself.called it, a great prose epic, as it has seemed to some, worthy to.compare with the great verse epics of old......PART ONE.....CHAPTER I...Over the open plain, beneath a starless sky as dark and thick as ink,.a man walked alone along the highway from Marchiennes to Montsou, a.straight paved road ten kilometres in length, intersecting the beetroot.fields
The man, who felt.that he was being looked at suspiciously, at once told his name..."I am called Étienne Lantier
Below, at Montsou, the Fauvelle sugar works.were still going, but the Hoton sugar works had just been dismissing.hands; there were only the Dutilleul flour mill and the Bleuze rope.walk for mine-cables which kept up
No other stars rose on the threatening horizon except.these nocturnal fires in a land of coal and iron..."You belong to Belgium, perhaps?" began again the carman, who had.returned behind Étienne...This time he only brought three trams
The latter, indeed, did not usually talk at such length..The unknown man's face must have pleased him that he should have been.taken by one of these itchings for confidence which sometimes make old.people talk aloud even when alone..."I belong to Montsou," he said, "I am called Bonnemort.".."Is it a nickname?" asked Étienne, astonished...The old man made a grimace of satisfaction and pointed to the Voreux:.."Yes, yes; they have pulled me three times out of that, torn to pieces,.once with all my hair scorched, once with my gizzard full of earth, and.another time with my belly swollen with water, like a frog
His grandfather, Guillaume Maheu, an urchin of.fifteen then, had found the rich coal at Réquillart, the Company's.first pit, an old abandoned pit to-day down below near the Fauvelle.sugar works
Then his father, Nicolas Maheu, called Le Rouge, when hardly.forty years of age had died in the pit, which was being excavated at.that time: a landslip, a complete slide, and the rock drank his blood.and swallowed his bones
He, Vincent Maheu, who had come.out almost whole, except that his legs were rather shaky, was looked.upon as a knowing fellow
But what could one do? One must work; one.worked here from father to son, as one would work at anything else..His son, Toussaint Maheu, was being worked to death there now, and his.grandsons, and all his people, who lived opposite in the settlement..A hundred and six years of mining, the youngsters after the old ones,.for the same master
Thomas, Madeleine, Feutry-Cantel, and still more, and six.for pumping or ventilation, like Réquillart
He asked:.."Then Monsieur Hennebeau owns the mine?".."No," explained the old man, "Monsieur Hennebeau is only the general.manager; he is paid just the same as us."..With a gesture the young man pointed into the darkness..."Who does it all belong to, then?"..But Bonnemort was for a moment so suffocated by a new and violent spasm.that he could not get his breath
In the bed on the left, Zacharie, the eldest,.a youth of one-and-twenty, was asleep with his brother Jeanlin, who.had completed his eleventh year; in the right-hand bed two urchins,.Lénore and Henri, the first six years old, the second four, slept in.each other's arms, while Catherine shared the third bed with her sister.Alzire, so small for her nine years that Catherine would not have felt.her near her if it were not for the little invalid's humpback, which.pressed into her side
As she passed by the bed of Henri and Lénore, she.replaced the coverlet which had slipped down
Alzire, with open eyes, had turned to.take the warm place of her big sister without speaking..."I say, now, Zacharie--and you, Jeanlin; I say, now!" repeated.Catherine, standing before her two brothers, who were still wallowing.with their noses in the bolster...She had to seize the elder by the shoulder and shake him; then, while.he was muttering abuse, it came into her head to uncover them by.snatching away the sheet
Good Lord! Say it's time to get up?"..He was lean and ill-made, with a long face and a chin which showed.signs of a sprouting beard, yellow hair, and the anaemic pallor which.belonged to his whole family...His shirt had rolled up to his belly, and he lowered it, not from.modesty but because he was not warm..."It has struck downstairs," repeated Catherine; "come! up! father's.angry."..Jeanlin, who had rolled himself up, closed his eyes, saying: "Go and.hang yourself; I'm going to sleep."..She laughed again, the laugh of a good-natured girl
"Levaque has gone down, and here is Bouteloup.come to join the Levaque woman."..Jeanlin grinned; even Alzire's eyes shone
Every morning they made fun.of the household of three next door, a pikeman who lodged a worker in.the cutting, an arrangement which gave the woman two men, one by night,.the other by day..."Philoméne is coughing," began Catherine again, after listening...She was speaking of the eldest Levaque, a big girl of nineteen, and.the mistress of Zacharie, by whom she had already had two children;.her chest was so delicate that she was only a sifter at the pit, never.having been able to work below..."Pooh! Philoméne!" replied Zacharie, "she cares a lot, she's asleep..It's hoggish to sleep till six."..He was putting on his breeches when an idea occurred to him, and he.opened the window
It was Estelle, in her cradle, vexed by the cold...Maheu woke up suddenly
The two youngsters, Lénore and Henri, in each.other's arms, had not stirred, breathing in the same quiet way in spite.of the noise..."Catherine, give me the candle," called out Maheu...She finished buttoning her jacket, and carried the candle into the.closet, leaving her brothers to look for their clothes by what light.came through the door
All.the sabots of the family were beneath the sideboard..."Will you be still, vermin?" began Maheu, again, exasperated by.Estelle's cries which still went on...He was short, like old Bonnemort, and resembled him, with his strong.head, his flat, livid face, beneath yellow hair cut very short
"I and Zacharie three: that makes.six, Catherine and the father, two: that makes four: four and six, ten,.and Jeanlin one, that makes eleven.".."Yes, eleven, but there are Sundays and the off-days
Maheu seemed.all at once to hear them, and, in a fury, snatched the little one up.from the cradle and threw it on the mother's bed, stammering with rage:.."Here, take her; I'll do for her! Damn the child! It wants for nothing:.it sucks, and it complains louder than all the rest!"..Estelle began, in fact, to suck
Yes,.I'll take Lénore and Henri to them this morning
Zacharie and Jeanlin were already going down;.he followed them, and the wooden staircase creaked beneath their heavy.feet, clad in wool
The children slept; even Alzire's eyelids were closed; but the.mother now remained with her eyes open in the darkness, while, pulling.at her breast, the pendent breast of an exhausted woman, Estelle was.purring like a kitten...Down below, Catherine had at first occupied herself with the fire,.which was burning in the iron grate, flanked by two ovens
At.last she decided, cut the slices, took one and covered it with cheese,.spread another with butter, and stuck them together; that was the."brick," the bread-and-butter sandwich taken to the pit every morning..The four bricks were soon on the table, in a row, cut with severe.justice, from the big one for the father down to the little one for.Jeanlin...Catherine, who appeared absorbed in her household duties, must,.however, have been thinking of the stories told by Zacharie about the.head captain and the Pierron woman, for she half opened the front door.and glanced outside
She had to be content to add the water to.last night's dregs; then she sugared the coffee-pot with brown sugar..At that moment her father and two brothers came downstairs..."Faith!" exclaimed Zacharie, when he had put his nose into his bowl,."here's something that won't get into our heads."..Maheu shrugged his shoulders with an air of resignation..."Bah! It's hot! It's good all the same."..Jeanlin had gathered up the fragments of bread and made a sop of them..After having drunk, Catherine finished by emptying the coffee-pot into.the tin-jacks
It was Maheude, who called out:.."Take all the bread: I have some vermicelli for the children.".."Yes, yes," replied Catherine...She had piled up the fire, wedging the pot that held the remains of the.soup into a corner of the grate, so that the grandfather might find.it warm when he came in at six
The house became dark again..."Ah! we're off together," said a man who was closing the door of the.next house...It was Levaque, with his son Bébert, an urchin of twelve, a great.friend of Jeanlin's
Catherine, in surprise, stifled a laugh in.Zacharie's ear:.."Why! Bouteloup didn't even wait until the husband had gone!"..Now the lights in the settlement were extinguished, and the last door.banged
He was beneath the pit-frame in the.receiving-room, at the very mouth of the shaft...A captain, Father Richomme, a big man with the face of a good-natured.gendarme, and with a straight grey moustache, was at that moment going.towards the receiver's office..."Do they want a hand here for any kind of work?" asked Étienne again...Richomme was about to say no, but he changed his mind and replied like.the others, as he went away:.."Wait for Monsieur Dansaert, the head captain."..Four lanterns were placed there, and the reflectors which threw all.the light on to the shaft vividly illuminated the iron rail, the.levers of the signals and bars, the joists of the guides along which.slid the two cages
It was the Maheu and Levaque set
But Maheu, behind her, had heard and replied,.talking with Étienne for a moment
He was working in a set; there were.four pikemen associated in his cutting, himself, Zacharie, Levaque, and.Chaval
If they had Catherine alone to wheel, the work would suffer...Suddenly he called out:.."I have it! there was that man looking for work!"..At that moment Dansaert passed before the shed
Maheu told him the.story, and asked for his authority to engage the man; he emphasized the.desire of the Company to substitute men for women, as at Anzin
But after some hesitation he gave his permission,.reserving its ratification for Monsieur Négrel, the engineer..."All very well!" exclaimed Zacharie; "the man must be away by this.time.".."No," said Catherine
"I saw him stop at the boilers.".."After him, then, lazy," cried Maheu...The young girl ran forward; while a crowd of miners proceeded to the.shaft, yielding the fire to others...Jeanlin, without waiting for his father, went also to take his lamp,.together with Bébert, a big, stupid boy, and Lydie, a small child of.ten
Then, when Maheu had shut up their sabots, their.stockings, as well as Étienne's bundle, he suddenly became impatient..."What is that lazy Chaval up to? Another girl given a tumble on a pile.of stones? We are half an hour late to-day."..Zacharie and Levaque were quietly roasting their shoulders
Maheu had to intervene to obtain a lamp for his new putter,.and there was still another precaution: the workers defiled before an.examiner, who assured himself that all the lamps were properly closed..."Golly! It's not warm here," murmured Catherine, shivering...Étienne contented himself with nodding his head
Maheu, Zacharie, and Catherine.slid into a tram below, and as all five had to enter, Étienne in.his turn went in, but the good places were taken; he had to squeeze.himself near the young girl, whose elbow pressed into his belly
Only the captain's.naked light, in the neighbouring tram, shone like a lighthouse..."This is four metres in diameter," continued Maheu, to instruct him.."The tubbing wants doing over again, for the water comes in everywhere..Stop! we are reaching the bottom: do you hear?"..Étienne was, in fact, now asking himself the meaning of this noise of.falling rain
A cavernous odour exhaled from the walls, a freshness of.saltpetre in which mingled hot breaths from the neighbouring stable..The openings of four galleries yawned here..."This way," said Maheu to Étienne
Some fifteen went off into that on the left, and Étienne.walked last, behind Maheu, who was preceded by Catherine, Zacharie,.and Levaque
On the first, and holding the.reins, was seated Bébert, while Jeanlin, with his hands leaning on the.edge of the last, was running barefooted behind...They again began their walk
After two hundred metres of.this, he saw Levaque, Zacharie, and Catherine disappear, as though they.had flown through a narrow fissure which was open in front of him..."We must climb," said Maheu
And he had still to climb the height of two cuttings! He was.blinded by sweat, and he despaired of catching up the others, whose.agile limbs he heard brushing against the rock with a long gliding.movement..."Cheer up! here we are!" said Catherine's voice...He had, in fact, arrived, and another voice cried from the bottom of.the cutting:.."Well, is this the way to treat people? I have two kilometres to walk.from Montsou and I am here first." It was Chaval, a tall, lean, bony.fellow of twenty-five, with strongly marked features, who was in a.bad humour at having to wait
When he saw Étienne he asked, with.contemptuous surprise:.."What's that?"..And when Maheu had told him the story he added between his teeth:.."These men are eating the bread of girls."..The two men exchanged a look, lighted up by one of those instinctive.hatreds which suddenly flame up
In order to attack the coal, they.had to lie on their sides with their necks twisted and arms raised,.brandishing, in a sloping direction, their short-handled picks...Below there was, first, Zacharie; Levaque and Chaval were on the.stages above, and at the very top was Maheu
Behind the pikemen nearly three metres of.the seam were clear, and they had not yet taken the precaution of.supporting the rock, having grown careless of danger and miserly of.their time..."Here, you swell," cried the young man to Étienne, "hand up some wood."..Étienne, who was learning from Catherine how to manage his shovel, had.to raise the wood in the cutting
Maheu first.began again to hammer, lower down, with his head level with the rock..Now the drop struck his forehead so obstinately that he seemed to feel.it piercing a hole in the bone of his skull..."You mustn't mind," explained Catherine to Étienne, "they are always.howling."..And like a good-natured girl she went on with her lesson
However, he felt she must be older, with her boyish freedom,.a simple audacity which confused him a little; she did not please him:.he thought her too roguish with her pale Pierrot head, framed at the.temples by the cap
All four were.naked, mixed up with the coal, soaked with black mud up to the cap..At one moment it had been necessary to free Maheu, who was gasping,.and to remove the planks so that the coal could fall into the passage..Zacharie and Levaque became enraged with the seam, which was now.hard, they said, and which would make the condition of their account.disastrous
He came.forward, having assured himself that Maheu could not see him; and as.Catherine was seated on the earth he seized her by the shoulders, drew.her head back, and tranquilly crushed her mouth beneath a brutal kiss,.affecting not to notice Étienne
Was that all? Was that the terrible thing which blew.everything up? She laughed, she said there was a good deal of it to-day.to make the flame of the lamps so blue..."Now, if you've done chattering, lazy louts!" cried Maheu's rough voice...Catherine and Étienne hastened to fill their trams, and pushed them.to the upbrow with stiffened back, crawling beneath the bossy roof of.the passage
At the bottom of their.mole-hill, beneath the weight of the earth, with no more breath in.their inflamed lungs, they went on hammering......CHAPTER V...Maheu, without looking at his watch which he had left in his jacket,.stopped and said:.."One o'clock directly
Then, when the two.others went on talking against the masters, he became restless, and.looked around him..."Hush! that's enough.".."You're right," said Levaque, also lowering his voice; "it isn't.wholesome."..A morbid dread of spies haunted them, even at this depth, as if the.shareholders' coal, while still in the seam, might have ears..."That won't prevent me," added Chaval loudly, in a defiant manner,."from lodging a brick in the belly of that damned Dansaert, if he talks.to me as he did the other day
Almost immediately the engineer of the mine, little Négrel,.as the workmen called him among themselves, appeared at the top of the.cutting, accompanied by Dansaert, the head captain..."Didn't I say so?" muttered Maheu
"There's always someone there,.rising out of the ground."..Paul Négrel, M
He was dressed like them, and.like them smeared with coal; to make them respect him he exhibited a.dare-devil courage, passing through the most difficult spots and always.first when landslips or fire-damp explosions occurred..."Here we are, are we not, Dansaert?" he asked...The head captain, a coarse-faced Belgian, with a large sensual nose,.replied with exaggerated politeness:.."Yes, Monsieur Négrel
Chaval.and Levaque, however, made a furious gesture, while Maheu restrained.them by a glance, and Zacharie shrugged his shoulders chaffingly
Was it possible to.kill oneself at this hard toil, in this deadly darkness, and not even.to gain the few pence to buy one's daily bread?..However, Négrel went off with Dansaert, who was content to approve by.a continual movement of his head
All of them, even Zacharie, were timbering furiously..For nearly half an hour one only heard the creaking of wood wedged in.by blows of the hammer...They no longer spoke, they snorted, became enraged with the rock, which.they would have hustled and driven back by the force of their shoulders.if they had been able..."That's enough," said Maheu at last, worn out with anger and fatigue.."An hour and a half! A fine day's work! We shan't get fifty sous! I'm.off
And the six, their tools.under their arms, set out to walk the two kilometres back, returning to.the shaft by the road of the morning...At the chimney Catherine and Étienne were delayed while the pikemen.slid down
As all three.returned to the pit-eye, Bébert and Jeanlin arrived there also with a.train of tubs
Perhaps he vaguely saw again, in the depths of his obscure.dreams, the mill at which he was born, near Marchiennes, a mill placed.on the edge of the Scarpe, surrounded by large fields over which the.wind always blew
It was a bay horse hardly three years of age, called Trompette..."Attention!" cried Father Mouque, whose duty it was to receive it.."Bring him here, don't undo him yet."..Trompette was soon placed on the metal floor in a mass
And Father Mouque led away the two beasts, fraternizing.together..."Here! Is it ready yet?" asked Maheu...It was necessary to clear the cages, and besides it was yet ten.minutes before the hour for ascending
Soon they could not restrain their voices; these men, soiled.by coal, and frozen by the delay, accused the Company of killing half.their workers at the bottom, and starving the other half to death..Étienne listened, trembling..."Quick, quick!" repeated the captain, Richomme, to the porters...He hastened the preparations for the ascent, not wishing to be hard,.pretending not to hear
They were calling out behind him that this.would not last always, and that one fine day the whole affair would be.smashed up..."You're sensible," he said to Maheu; "make them hold their tongues..When one hasn't got power one must have sense."..But Maheu, who was getting calm, and had at last become anxious, did.not interfere
Suddenly the voices fell; Négrel and Dansaert, returning.from their inspection, entered from a gallery, both of them sweating..The habit of discipline made the men stand in rows while the engineer.passed through the group without a word
A lander opened the.door, and a flood of workmen leapt out of the trams..."I say, Mouquet," whispered Zacharie in the lander's ear, "are we off.to the Volcan to-night?"..The Volcan was a café-concert at Montsou
With head protected by a fragment of blue wool,.and hands and arms black to the elbows, she was screening beneath an.old witch, the mother of Pierronne, the Brulé, as she was called, with.terrible owl's eyes, and a mouth drawn in like a miser's purse
Jeanlin confided to Bébert a.complicated plan for getting four sous' worth of tobacco on credit,.while Lydie followed respectfully at a distance
Catherine came with.Zacharie and Étienne
And it was only in front of.the Avantage inn that Maheu and Levaque rejoined them..."Here we are," said the former to Étienne; "will you come in?"..They separated
The Company, who had done.everything to buy up the property placed within its vast territory, was.in despair over this inn in the open fields, at the very entrance of.the Voreux..."Go in," said Maheu to Étienne...The little parlour was quite bare with its white walls, its three.tables and its dozen chairs, its deal counter about the size of a.kitchen dresser
Look how fresh you are, these three years that.you've been out of it.".."Yes, I'm very much better," declared Rasseneur, complacently...Étienne went as far as the door, thanking the miner, who was leaving;.but the latter nodded his head without adding a word, and the young.man watched him painfully climb up the road to the settlement
And beneath the livid sky,.in the faint daylight of this winter afternoon, it seemed as if all the.blackness of the Voreux, and all its flying coal dust, had fallen upon.the plain, powdering the trees, sanding the roads, sowing the earth...Étienne looked, and what especially surprised him was a canal, the.canalized stream of the Scarpe, which he had not seen in the night..From the Voreux to Marchiennes this canal ran straight, like a dull.silver ribbon two leagues long, an avenue lined by large trees, raised.above the low earth, threading into space with the perspective of its.green banks, its pale water into which glided the vermilion of the.boats
And he thought fiercely of those people Bonnemort had.talked of, the crouching and sated god, to whom ten thousand starving.men gave their flesh without knowing it......PART TWO.....CHAPTER I...The Grégoires' property, Piolaine, was situated two kilometres to the.east of Montsou, on the Joiselle road
Every morning he liked to give a glance round.Piolaine, which was not large enough to cause him anxiety, and from.which he derived all the happiness of ownership..."And Cécile?" he asked, "isn't she up yet then?".."I can't make it out," replied his wife
It was very hot, and.not a sound was heard in the silent house...The Grégoires' fortune, about forty thousand francs a year, was.entirely invested in a share of the Montsou mines
to exploit the Montsou concession, and the pits.began to yield a small profit when two neighbouring concessions, that.of Cougny, belonging to the Comte de Cougny, and that of Joiselle,.belonging to the Cornille and Jenard Company, had nearly overwhelmed.him beneath the terrible assault of their competition
Desrumaux, dying but triumphant, received in.this division six sous and three deniers...In those days the baron possessed Piolaine, which had three hundred.hectares belonging to it, and he had in his service as steward Honoré.Grégoire, a Picardy lad, the great-grandfather of Léon Grégoire,.Cécile's father
When the Montsou treaty was made, Honoré, who had.laid up savings to the amount of some fifty thousand francs, yielded.tremblingly to his master's unshakable faith
The fortune.began with Félicien, who was able to realize a dream with which his.grandfather, the old steward, had nursed his childhood--the purchase.of dismembered Piolaine, which he acquired as national property for.a ludicrous sum
It was necessary to.await the conclusion of the revolutionary catastrophes, and afterwards.Napoleon's bloody fall; and it was Léon Grégoire who profited at a.stupefying rate of progress by the timid and uneasy investment of his.great-grandfather
"I came out on.horseback to rub off the rust a bit, and as I passed your door I.thought I would just look in."..Cécile questioned him about Jeanne and Lucie, his daughters
His wife.possessed, through an uncle, the little concession of Vandame, where.only two pits were open--Jean-Bart and Gaston-Marie--in an abandoned.state, and with such defective material that the output hardly covered.the cost
Now he was meditating the repair of Jean-Bart, the renewal.of the engine, and the enlargement of the shaft so as to facilitate.the descent, keeping Gaston-Marie only for exhaustion purposes
Besides, he was a bad manager, with a rough kindness.towards his workmen, and since his wife's death he allowed himself to.be pillaged, and also gave the rein to his daughters, the elder of whom.talked of going on the stage, while the younger had already had three.landscapes refused at the Salon, both of them joyous amid the downfall,.and exhibiting in poverty their capacity for good household management..."You see, Léon," he went on, in a hesitating voice, "you were wrong not.to sell out at the same time as I did; now everything is going down..You run risk, and if you had confided your money to me you would have.seen what we should have done at Vandame in our mine!"..M
It doesn't do to be so diabolically greedy! Then, listen, it is.you who will bite your fingers one day, for Montsou will rise again and.Cécile's grandchildren will still get their white bread out of it."..Deneulin listened with a constrained smile..."Then," he murmured, "if I were to ask you to put a hundred thousand.francs in my affair you would refuse?"..But seeing the Grégoires' disturbed faces he regretted having gone so.far; he put off his idea of a loan, reserving it until the case was.desperate..."Oh! I have not got to that! it is a joke
The confined air stupefied.them so that they continued their night's slumber: Lénore and Henri in.each other's arms, Alzire with her head back, lying on her hump; while.Father Bonnemort, having the bed of Zacharie and Jeanlin to himself,.snored with open mouth
No sound came from the closet where Maheude had.gone to sleep again while suckling Estelle, her breast hanging to one.side, the child lying across her belly, stuffed with milk, overcome.also and stifling in the soft flesh of the bosom...The clock below struck six
Dress Lénore and Henri, I'll take them with.me; and you can take care of Estelle; I don't want to drag her along.for fear of hurting her, this dog's weather."..She hastily washed herself and put on an old blue skirt, her cleanest,.and a loose jacket of grey wool in which she had made two patches the.evening before..."And the soup! Good gracious!" she muttered again...When her mother had gone down, upsetting everything, Alzire went back.into the room taking with her Estelle, who had begun screaming
It was time, for now another disturbance broke out, and she.had to make peace between Lénore and Henri, who at last awoke
"I have to go out."..And for fear of giving way to the offer of a glass of hot coffee she.pushed Lénore and Henri, and set out with them
Behind a clump of poplars the old Réquillart pit exhibited.its crumbling steeple, of which the large skeleton alone stood upright..And turning to the right, Maheude found herself on the high road..."Stop, stop, dirty pig! I'll teach you to make mincemeat."..Now it was Henri, who had taken a handful of mud and was moulding it..The two children had their ears impartially boxed, and were brought.into good order, looking out of the corner of their eyes at the mud.pies they had made
And amid the sugar works, the rope works, and.the flour mills, there stood out ballrooms, restaurants, and beershops,.which were so numerous that to every thousand houses there were more.than five hundred inns...As she approached the Company's Yards, a vast series of storehouses and.workshops, Maheude decided to take Henri and Lénore by the hand, one on.the right, the other on the left
Hennebeau, a sort of vast chalet, separated from the road.by a grating, and then a garden in which some lean trees vegetated..Just then, a carriage had stopped before the door and a gentleman.with decorations and a lady in a fur cloak alighted: visitors just.arrived from Paris at the Marchiennes station, for Madame Hennebeau,.who appeared in the shadow of the porch, was uttering exclamations of.surprise and joy..."Come along, then, dawdlers!" growled Maheude, pulling the two little.ones, who were standing in the mud...When she arrived at Maigrat's, she was quite excited
And she went off, violently.dragging Lénore and Henri who were occupied in picking up nut-shells.from the gutter where they were making investigations..."This won't bring you luck, Monsieur Maigrat, remember!"..Now there only remained the Piolaine people
As she.walked she was already spending the five francs, first bread, then.coffee, afterwards a quarter of butter, a bushel of potatoes for the.morning soup and the evening stew; finally, perhaps, a bit of pig's.chitterlings, for the father needed meat...The Curé of Montsou, Abbé Joire, was passing, holding up his cassock,.with the delicate air of a fat, well-nourished cat afraid of wetting.its fur
In the dining-room.the mother and children stood motionless, dazed by the sudden heat, and.very constrained beneath the gaze of this old lady and gentleman, who.were stretched out in their easy-chairs..."Cécile," said the old lady, "fulfil your little duties."..The Grégoires charged Cécile with their charities
While the housemaid went upstairs, the cook forgot her.duties, leaving the rest of the brioche on the table, and stood there.swinging her empty hands..."I still have two woollen dresses and some comforters," Cécile went on;."you will see how warm they will be, the poor dears!"..Then Maheude found her tongue, and stammered:.."Thank you so much, mademoiselle
It was necessary, all the same, to feed the.little ones who brought nothing in..."Then," said Madame Grégoire, "you have worked for a long time at the.mines?"..A silent laugh lit up Maheude's pale face..."Ah, yes! ah, yes! I went down till I was twenty
Besides, it must.be understood that a collier needed a glass to wash away the dust..It began there, and then he was always in the inn when worries came..Without complaining of any one it might be that the workmen did not.earn as much as they ought to..."I thought," said Madame Grégoire, "that the Company gave you lodging.and firing?"..Maheude glanced sideways at the flaming coal in the fireplace..."Yes, yes, they give us coal, not very grand, but it burns
They would all fit beautifully;.she hastened and made the servants wrap up the chosen garments; for her.music mistress had just arrived; and she pushed the mother and children.towards the door..."We are very short," stammered Maheude; "if we only had a five-franc.piece--"..The phrase was stifled, for the Maheus were proud and never begged..Cécile looked uneasily at her father; but the latter refused.decisively, with an air of duty..."No, it is not our custom
As she passed.through Montsou she resolutely entered Maigrat's shop, and begged so.persistently that at last she carried away two loaves, coffee, butter,.and even her five-franc piece, for the man also lent money by the week..It was not her that he wanted, it was Catherine; she understood that.when he advised her to send her daughter for provisions
Catherine would box his ears if he came too close under her.nose......CHAPTER III...Eleven o'clock struck at the little church in the Deux-Cent-Quarante.settlement, a brick chapel to which Abbé Joire came to say mass.on Sundays
As the Company reserved this new experiment for.the captains, the workpeople called this corner of the hamlet the.settlement of the Bas-de-Soie, just as they called their own settlement.Paie-tes-Dettes, in good-humoured irony of their wretchedness..."Eh! Here we are," said Maheude, laden with parcels, pushing in Lénore.and Henri, covered with mud and quite tired out...In front of the fire Estelle was screaming, cradled in Alzire's arms..The latter, having no more sugar and not knowing how to soothe her, had.decided to pretend to give her the breast
She looked at the empty hands.of Lénore and Henri who were fighting on the floor, already rested and.lively
Then.she went out with Estelle in her arms, leaving old Bonnemort to chew.his potatoes leisurely, while Lénore and Henri fought for the fallen.parings...Instead of going round, Maheude went straight across through the.gardens, for fear lest Levaque's wife should call her
The only drawback to all this.happiness was Mother Brulé, who screamed with all the rage of an old.revolutionary, having to avenge the death of her man on the masters,.and little Lydie, who pocketed, in the shape of frequent blows, the.passions of the family..."How big she is already!" said Pierronne, simpering at Estelle..."Oh! the trouble that it gives! Don't talk of it!" said Maheude
Those of the Levaques were very dirty, veritable kitchen.clouts, which seemed to have wiped the bottoms of the saucepans..."How can they live in such dirt?" murmured Pierronne...Then Maheude began and did not stop
And then the husband had taken to drink, beat his wife, and.ran after the singers at the Montsou café-concerts...Pierronne assumed an air of profound disgust
It.was of no consequence; they married afterwards, only the mothers were.angry when their lads began too soon, for a lad who married no longer.brought anything into the family..."In your place I would have done with it," said Pierronne, sensibly.."Your Zacharie has already filled her twice, and they will go on and.get spliced
The earth-cutting man stopped digging for a moment, and.two disturbed fowls took fright in the gardens...As Maheude returned, she ran against the Levaque woman who had come out.to stop Dr
And they.were only interrupted by the arrival of a neighbour bringing in a.little urchin of nine months, Désirée, Philoméne's youngest; Philoméne,.taking her breakfast at the screening-shed, had arranged that they.should bring her little one down there, where she suckled it, seated.for a moment in the coal..."I can't leave mine for a moment, she screams directly," said Maheude,.looking at Estelle, who was asleep in her arms...But she did not succeed in avoiding the domestic affair which she had.read in the other's eyes..."I say, now we ought to get that settled."..At first the two mothers, without need for talking about it, had agreed.not to conclude the marriage
If Zacharie's mother wished to get her.son's wages as long as possible, Philoméne's mother was enraged at the.idea of abandoning her daughter's wages
Besides, she was only repeating odd phrases which.she had overheard, without ever troubling herself further about this.race of workpeople who were labouring and suffering beside her..."What beautiful children!" murmured the lady, who thought them hideous,.with their large heads beneath their bushy, straw-coloured hair...And Maheude had to tell their ages; they also asked her questions about.Estelle, out of politeness
Father Bonnemort respectfully took his pipe.out of his mouth; but he was not the less a subject of uneasiness, so.worn out by his forty years underground, with his stiff limbs, deformed.body, and earthy face; and as a violent spasm of coughing took him.he preferred to go and spit outside, with the idea that his black.expectoration would make people uncomfortable...Alzire received all the compliments
It's Catherine that he's.after.".."Why, didn't she have the cheek to say just now that she would strangle.Catherine if she were to come to that? As if big Chaval for ever so.long had not put her backside on the shed!".."Hush! here they are!"..Then Levaque and Pierronne, with a peaceful air and without impolite.curiosity, contented themselves with watching the visitors out of the.corners of their eyes
Then there was.confusion among the women: they all began to run home with the terror.of housekeepers who had been led astray by too much coffee and too much.tattle, and one heard nothing more than this restless cry, pregnant.with quarrels:.."Good Lord, and my soup! and my soup which isn't ready!".....CHAPTER IV...When Maheu came in after having left Étienne at Rasseneur's, he found.Catherine, Zacharie, and Jeanlin seated at the table finishing their.soup
He laughed with satisfaction...Catherine and Jeanlin had risen, and were taking their coffee standing;.while Zacharie, not filled with the soup, cut himself a large slice of.bread and covered it with butter
No one looked.at her, even Lénore and Henri were no longer inquisitive to see how.she was made
But.a quarrel broke out between the two brothers: Jeanlin had hastened to.jump into the tub under the pretence that Zacharie was still eating;.and the latter hustled him, claiming his turn, and calling out that he.was polite enough to allow Catherine to wash herself first, but he did.not wish to have the rinsings of the young urchins, all the less since,.when Jeanlin had been in, it would do to fill the school ink-pots
And there was silence again...But the odour of the meat made Lénore and Henri lift up their heads.from the floor, where they were amusing themselves with making rivulets.with the spilt water
He seated Lénore on his left thigh, Henri on.the right; then he finished the chitterlings by playing at dinner.with them
At a look, Alzire led Lénore and Henri outside to play
He blamed no one, however; he simply said.that it was good for the children to dabble together..."What are you doing up there?" cried Maheude, up the staircase..."I'm mending my dress that I tore yesterday," replied Catherine..."All right
Don't come down, your father is washing."..Then Maheu and Maheude were left alone
She afterwards told him about Madame Hennebeau's visit..Without saying so, both of them were proud of this..."Can I come down yet?" asked Catherine, from the top of the staircase..."Yes, yes; your father is drying himself."..The young girl had put on her Sunday dress, an old frock of rough blue.poplin, already faded and worn in the folds
Levaque, refreshed and excited by thrashing his wife,.vainly tried to take Maheu off to Rasseneur's
In reality he refused out of good sense, not wishing to.ask a farthing from his wife out of the change of the five-franc piece...Five o'clock was striking when Pierronne came to know if it was with.Jeanlin that her Lydie had gone off
Now the.school was closed; and all the children were running about, there was.a swarm of little creatures shouting and tumbling and fighting; while.those fathers who were not at the public-house were resting in groups.of three or four, crouching on their heels as they did in the mine,.smoking their pipes with an occasional word in the shelter of a wall..Pierronne went off in a fury when Levaque wanted to feel if her thighs.were firm; and he himself decided to go alone to Rasseneur's, since.Maheu was still planting...Twilight suddenly came on; Maheude lit the lamp, irritated because.neither her daughter nor the boys had come back
The clock struck seven; Henri and Lénore had just.broken a plate in persisting in helping Alzire, who was laying the.table, when Father Bonnemort came in first, in a hurry to dine and go.back to the pit
Then Maheude woke up Maheu..."Come and eat! So much the worse! They are big enough to find the.house
Étienne saw her disappear, with her eagle nose,.her flying white hair, her long, lean arms that gesticulated furiously..But the conversation of two young people behind caused him to listen..He had recognized Zacharie, who was waiting there, and who had just.been addressed by his friend Mouquet..."Are you here?" said the latter
The two men simply wished each other good.evening, the son taking the main road while the father went along by.the canal...Zacharie was already pushing Philoméne in spite of her resistance into.the same solitary path
He stopped...At the bottom of the pit-bank, in a hollow into which some large stones.had slipped, little Jeanlin was violently snubbing Lydie and Bébert,.seated one at his right, the other at his left..."What do you say? Eh? I'll slap each of you if you want more
After having roamed about in the.meadows, along the canal, for an hour, gathering dandelions with the.two others, it had occurred to him, before this pile of salad, that.they would never eat all that at home; and instead of going back to the.settlement he had gone to Montsou, keeping Bébert to watch, and making.Lydie ring at the houses and offer the dandelions
He called that playing at papa and mama; and.when he chased her she ran away and let herself be caught with the.delicious trembling of instinct, often angry, but always yielding, in.the expectation of something which never came...As Bébert was not admitted to these games and received a cuffing.whenever he wanted to touch Lydie, he was always constrained, agitated.by anger and uneasiness when the other two were amusing themselves,.which they did not hesitate to do in his presence
Ah! those were fine days..And the two old men, shaking their heads, at last left each other,.often without saying good night...That evening, however, as Étienne arrived, Father Bonnemort, who was.getting up from the beam to return to the settlement, said to Mouque:.."Good night, old man
An idea of economy had come to her, a sort of superstitious.fear, the certainty that that ribbon would bring her bad luck if she.were to buy it now...She hastened to regain the road to the settlement, and had reached the.last houses of Montsou when a man at the door of the Piquette Estaminet.called her:.."Eh! Catherine! where are you off to so quick?"..It was lanky Chaval
It had been his idea for a long time to persuade.her to come up to the room which he occupied on the first story of the.Estaminet Piquette, a fine room for a household, with a large bed
And beyond, in the flat plain,.shade had submerged everything, Montsou, Marchiennes, the forest of.Vandame, the immense sea of beetroot and of wheat, in which there only.shone, like distant lighthouses, the blue fires of the blast furnaces,.and the red fires of the coke ovens
And.every time the same meetings took place: a captain lighting up the.faces of the passing workmen, Father Mouque leading a horse, Bébert.conducting the snorting Bataille, Jeanlin running behind the tram to.close the ventilation doors, and big Mouquette and lean Lydie pushing.their trams...After a time, also, Étienne suffered much less from the damp and.closeness of the cutting
In all.other respects he was accepted and looked upon as a real miner, reduced.beneath this pressure of habit, little by little, to a machine...Maheu regarded Étienne with special friendship, for he respected work.that was well done
Things dragged.on; a deep discontent was fomenting in the pit, and Maheu himself, in.spite of his calmness, was beginning to clench his fists...There was at first some rivalry between Zacharie and Étienne
It was an endless vista.undulating beneath the slightest breeze; and he saw it spread and grow.from day to day, and was sometimes surprised, as if he had found it in.the evening more swollen with verdure than it had been in the morning..The poplars along the canal were putting on their plumes of leaves..Grass was invading the pit-bank, flowers were covering the meadows, a.whole life was germinating and pushing up from this earth beneath which.he was groaning in misery and fatigue...When Étienne now went for a walk in the evening he no longer startled.lovers behind the pit-bank
Zacharie and Philoméne came back to.it out of old domestic habit; Mother Brulé, always on Lydie's heels,.was constantly hunting her out with Jeanlin, buried so deeply together.that one had to tread on them before they made up their minds to get.up; and as to Mouquette, she lay about everywhere--one could not cross.a field without seeing her head plunge down while only her feet emerged.as she lay at full length
Then,.lying in a heap against him, her ears laid back, she would close her.eyes; and without growing tired, with an unconscious caressing gesture,.he would pass his hand over her grey silky fur, calmed by that warm.living softness..."You know I have had a letter from Pluchart," said Étienne one evening...Only Rasseneur was there
It seems that they are coming.in from all sides.".."What have you got to say, eh, about their society?" asked Rasseneur of.Souvarine...The latter, who was softly scratching Poland's head, blew out a puff of.smoke and muttered, with his tranquil air:.."More foolery!"..But Étienne grew enthusiastic
At last he had borrowed a French.book on Co-operative Societies--mere foolery, said Souvarine; and.he also regularly read a newspaper which the latter received, the.Combat, an Anarchist journal published at Geneva
But, meanwhile, the hewers could not stand with folded.arms, and placards announced that the Company would put up new workings.to auction...Maheu, on coming out one day, accompanied Étienne and offered to take.him on as a pikeman in his working, in place of Levaque who had gone.to another yard
So.Étienne merely had to accept this rapid promotion, glad of the growing.esteem in which Maheu held him...In the evening they returned together to the pit to take note of the.placards
All the rivals went lower,.disquieted by the rumours of a crisis and the panic of a lock-out..Négrel, the engineer, did not hurry in the face of this panic, and.allowed the offers to fall to the lowest possible figures, while.Dansaert, anxious to push matters still further, lied with regard to.the quality of the workings
In order to get his fifty metres, Maheu.struggled with a comrade who was also obstinate; in turn they each took.off a centime from the tram; and if he conquered in the end it was only.by lowering the wage to such an extent, that the captain Richomme, who.was standing behind him, muttered between his teeth, and nudged him.with his elbow, growling angrily that he could never do it at that.price...When they came out Étienne was swearing
Father Bonnemort had taken a chair.outside, to sit in the sun, while the mother and Alzire had at once set.about cooking
Catherine appeared, pushing before her Lénore and Henri,.whom she had just dressed
Eleven o'clock struck, and the odour of the.rabbit, which was boiling with potatoes, was already filling the house.when Zacharie and Jeanlin came down last, still yawning and with their.swollen eyes...The settlement was now in a flutter, excited by the feast-day, and.in expectation of dinner, which was being hastened for the departure.in bands to Montsou
This quarrel had strengthened the relations.with Pierronne, only Pierronne had left Pierron and Lydie with her.mother, and set out early in the morning to spend the day with a cousin.at Marchiennes; and they joked, for they knew this cousin; she had a.moustache, and was head captain at the Voreux
Bébert was waiting for him behind the school,.and they prowled about for a long time before they were able to entice.away Lydie, whom Brulé, who had decided not to go out, was trying.to keep with her
When she perceived that the child had fled, she.shouted and brandished her lean arms, while Pierron, annoyed at the.disturbance, strolled quietly away with the air of a husband who can.amuse himself with a good conscience, knowing that his wife also has.her little amusements...Old Bonnemort set out at last, and Maheu decided to have a little fresh.air after asking Maheude if she would come and join him down below..No, she couldn't at all, it was nothing but drudgery with the little.ones; but perhaps she would, all the same; she would think about it:.they could easily find each other
There he.found Zacharie, who was waiting for Philoméne, and the Levaque woman.started again on that everlasting subject of marriage, saying that.she was being made fun of and that she would have an explanation with.Maheude once and for all
Was life worth living when one had to keep.one's daughter's fatherless children while she went off with her lover?.Philoméne quietly finished putting on her bonnet, and Zacharie took.her off, saying that he was quite willing if his mother was willing..As Levaque had already gone, Maheu referred his angry neighbour to his.wife and hastened to depart
As her father turned.the corner of the church, Catherine perceived Chaval, and, hastening to.join him, they took together the Montsou road
In the settlement there were.only the women left, inviting each other to finish the dregs of the.coffee-pots, around tables that were still warm and greasy with the.dinner...Maheu had guessed that Levaque was at the Avantage, and he slowly.went down to Rasseneur's
A burning sun struck down on them.perpendicularly; there was only one streak of shade by the side of the.inn; and Étienne was there drinking his glass before a table, annoyed.because Souvarine had just left him to go up to his room
Besides, her.father was watching the game without even taking his eyes from the.fallen skittles..."Ah!" Levaque went on, throwing a look towards Étienne: "one can tell.where you're casting sheep's eyes, my girl! You'll have to take him by.force."..Then Étienne brightened up
She remained planted behind the hedge for some.minutes longer, looking at him with large fixed eyes; then she slowly.went away, and her face suddenly became serious as if she were overcome.by the powerful sun...In a low voice Étienne was again giving long explanations to Maheu.regarding the necessity for the Montsou miners to establish a Provident.Fund
And, having persuaded Étienne and.Levaque, the three set out for Montsou, at the same moment that a new.band took possession of the skittles at the Avantage...On the road they had to pause at the Casimir Bar, and then at the.Estaminet du Progrés
Then they thought of the.Estaminet Saint-Éloi and accepted there a round from Captain Richomme..Then they rambled from bar to bar, without any pretext, simply saying.that they were having a stroll..."We must go to the Volcan!" suddenly said Levaque, who was getting.excited...The others began to laugh, and hesitated
"We will talk about it."..He was excited by an enormous blonde, and determined to remain behind.when Maheu and Pierron, after drinking their glasses, set out without.waiting for a second song...Outside, Étienne who had gone with them found Mouquette, who seemed to.be following them
Let us go to.Piquette's."..But as they all three arrived at the Estaminet Piquette, sounds of.a quarrel arrested them at the door; Zacharie with his fist was.threatening a thick-set phlegmatic Walloon nail-maker, while Chaval,.with his hands in his pockets, was looking on..."Hullo! there's Chaval," said Maheu quietly; "he is with Catherine."..For five long hours the putter and her lover had been walking about.the fair
Another meeting made them.angry; they caught sight of Jeanlin inciting Bébert and Lydie to steal.bottles of gin from an extemporized bar installed at the edge of an.open piece of ground
It was a _batisecouic_ which gained the.first prize, a metal coffee-pot...Catherine and Chaval were there when Zacharie and Philoméne entered..They shook hands, and all stayed together
I tell you I don't care a damn for him."..Maheu now arrived with his party, and quieted Catherine and Philoméne.who were in tears
Étienne had.touched glasses with Catherine, and all drank together--the father,.the daughter and her lover, the son and his mistress--saying politely:."To your good health!" Pierron afterwards persisted in paying for more.drinks
And they were all in good humour, when Zacharie grew wild again.at the sight of his comrade Mouquet, and called him, as he said, to go.and finish his affair with the nail-maker..."I shall have to go and do for him! Here, Chaval, keep Philoméne with.Catherine
Maheu, Étienne, and Pierron, having come in to sit.down, had found Chaval at the Bon-Joyeux dancing with Catherine, while.Philoméne by herself was looking on
Neither Levaque nor Zacharie had.reappeared
Maheu pointed out Mouquette to Étienne: she was as.round and greasy as a bladder of lard, revolving violently in the arms.of a tall, lean lander
She had been obliged to console herself and.take a man...At last, at eight o'clock, Maheude appeared with Estelle at her breast,.followed by Alzire, Henri, and Lénore
Other women came in, and they whispered together.when they saw, behind Maheude, the Levaque woman enter with Bouteloup,.who led in by the hand Achille and Désirée, Philoméne's little ones..The two neighbours seemed to be getting on well together, one turning.round to chat with the other
On the way there had been a great.explanation, and Maheude had resigned herself to Zacharie's marriage,.in despair at the loss of her eldest son's wages, but overcome by the.thought that she could not hold it back any longer without injustice..She was trying, therefore, to put a good face on it, though with an.anxious heart, as a housekeeper who was asking herself how she could.make both ends meet now that the best part of her purse was going..."Place yourself there, neighbour," she said, pointing to a table near.that where Maheu was drinking with Étienne and Pierron..."Is not my husband with you?" asked the Levaque woman...The others told her that he would soon come
She accepted a chair, and seemed pleased to hear.that she was at last to be married; then, as they were looking for.Zacharie, she replied in her soft voice:.."I am waiting for him; he is over there."..Maheu had exchanged a look with his wife
He also felt anxiety for the.morrow in face of the ingratitude of these children, who got married.one by one leaving their parents in wretchedness...The dancing still went on, and the end of a quadrille drowned the.ball-room in red dust; the walls cracked, a cornet produced shrill.whistling sounds like a locomotive in distress; and when the dancers.stopped they were smoking like horses..."Do you remember?" said the Levaque woman, bending towards Maheude's.ear; "you talked of strangling Catherine if she did anything foolish!"..Chaval brought Catherine back to the family table, and both of them.standing behind the father finished their glasses..."Bah!" murmured Maheude, with an air of resignation, "one says things.like that--
Why.should they not take a lodger? Étienne, for example, who was looking.out for quarters? They would have room since Zacharie was going to.leave them, and the money that they would lose in that direction would.be in part regained in the other
Good conduct, that's the best Provident Fund."..Then Maheu took possession of Étienne, and squarely, like a good man,.proposed to take him as a lodger
The matter was settled in three words, Maheude declaring that.they would wait for the marriage of the children...Just then, Zacharie at last came back, with Mouquet and Levaque
He had to carry her away in his.arms while Jeanlin and Bébert, who were more sober, followed him.behind, thinking it a great joke
At the same moment.Father Bonnemort and old Mouque also left Montsou, walking in the.same somnambulistic manner, preserving the obstinate silence of their.recollections
During the first days,.the young man experienced some constraint in the presence of Catherine..There was a constant intimacy, as he everywhere replaced the elder.brother, sharing Jeanlin's bed over against the big sister's
All the modesty of the family had.taken refuge in the daily bath, for which the young girl now went.upstairs alone, while the men bathed below one after the other...At the end of the first month, Étienne and Catherine seemed no longer.to see each other when in the evening, before extinguishing the candle,.they moved about the room, undressed
This made them restless and sulky all the following day;.they liked best the tranquil evenings when they could behave together.like comrades...Étienne only complained of Jeanlin, who slept curled up
Alzire.slept lightly, and Lénore and Henri were found in the morning, in.each other's arms, exactly as they had gone to sleep
Ah! it was springing up, it was.springing up, little by little, a rough harvest of men who would ripen.in the sun! From the moment when they were no longer each of them stuck.to his place for his whole existence, and when they had the ambition to.take a neighbour's place, why should they not hit out with their fists.and try for the mastery?..Maheu was shaken but remained full of doubts..."As soon as you move they give you back your certificate," he said.."The old man is right; it will always be the miner who gets all the.trouble, without a chance of a leg of mutton now and then as a reward."..Maheude, who had been silent for a while, awoke as from a dream..."But if what the priests tell is true, if the poor people in this world.become the rich ones in the next!"..A burst of laughter interrupted her; even the children shrugged their.shoulders, being incredulous in the open air, keeping a secret fear of.ghosts in the pit, but glad of the empty sky..."Ah! bosh! the priests!" exclaimed Maheu
Father Bonnemort spat into his.handkerchief, while Maheu sat with his extinguished pipe, which he had.forgotten, in his mouth
Alzire listened between Lénore and Henri,.who were sleeping on the edge of the table
But Catherine, with her.chin in her hand, never took her large clear eyes off Étienne while he.was protesting, declaring his faith, and opening out the enchanting.future of his social dream
Catherine, without moving, her chin.always resting in her hand, kept her eyes fixed on Étienne, and when he.stopped a slight shudder passed over her, and she was quite pale as if.she felt the cold...But Maheude looked at the clock..."Past nine! Can it be possible? We shall never get up to-morrow."..And the Maheus left the table with hearts ill at ease and in despair..It seemed to them that they had just been rich and that they had now.suddenly fallen back into the mud
Father Bonnemort, who was setting.out for the pit, growled that those sort of stories wouldn't make the.soup better; while the others went upstairs in single file, noticing.the dampness of the walls and the pestiferous stuffiness of the air..Upstairs, amid the heavy slumber of the settlement when Catherine had.got into bed last and blown out the candle, Étienne heard her tossing.feverishly before getting to sleep...Often at these conversations the neighbours came in: Levaque, who.grew excited at the idea of a general sharing; Pierron, who prudently.went to bed as soon as they attacked the Company
The more they lived side by side, the more a barrier.was raised of shames, repugnancies, delicacies of friendship, which.they could not explain even to themselves......CHAPTER IV..."Listen," said Maheude to her man, "when you go to Montsou for the pay,.just bring me back a pound of coffee and a kilo of sugar."..He was sewing one of his shoes, in order to spare the cobbling..."Good!" he murmured, without leaving his task..."I should like you to go to the butcher's too
The men did not hurry, therefore, but waited about, going off.one by one, beset by the women, who implored them to come back at once..Many gave them commissions, to prevent them forgetting themselves in.public-houses...At Rasseneur's Étienne had received news
In his fat,.good-humoured nature, nourished on beer, a secret jealousy was forming,.increased by the desertion of his bar, into which the workmen from.the Voreux now came more rarely to drink and to listen; and he thus.sometimes even began to defend the Company, forgetting the rancour of.an old miner who had been turned off..."Then you are against the strike?" cried Madame Rasseneur, without.leaving the counter...And as he energetically replied, "Yes!" she made him hold his tongue..."Bah! you have no courage; let these gentlemen speak."..Étienne was meditating, with his eyes fixed on the glass which she had.served to him
Here's his letter."..In fact, Pluchart, in despair at the suspicion which the International.aroused among the miners at Montsou, was hoping to see them enter in a.mass if they were forced to fight against the Company
But an unforeseen drama.interrupted him: Poland, the big tame rabbit, which had ventured.outside, came bounding back, fleeing from the stones of a band of.trammers; and in her terror, with fallen ears and raised tail, she took.refuge against his legs, scratching and imploring him to take her up..When he had placed her on his knees, he sheltered her with both hands,.and fell into that kind of dreamy somnolence into which the caress of.this soft warm fur always plunged him...Almost at the same time Maheu came in
Étienne had risen, and both of them.set out for Montsou...On pay-day at the Company's Yards, Montsou seemed to be in the midst of.a fete as on fine Sunday feast-days
As Maheu and.Étienne advanced among the groups they felt that on that day a deep.exasperation was rising up
Fists were clenched.and violent words were passing from mouth to mouth..."Is it true, then," asked Maheu of Chaval, whom he met before the.Estaminet Piquette, "that they've played the dirty trick?"..But Chaval contented himself by replying with a furious growl, throwing.a sidelong look on Étienne
He never took Catherine to Réquillart now or behind the.pit-bank without accusing her in abominable language of sleeping with.her mother's lodger; then, seized by savage desire, he would stifle her.with caresses...Maheu asked him another question:.."Is it the Voreux's turn now?"..And when he turned his back after nodding affirmatively, both men.decided to enter the Yards...The counting-house was a small rectangular room, divided in two by a.grating
Many came.in thus to look, without understanding..."Read us that there!" said Maheu, who was not very strong either in.reading, to his companion...Then Étienne began to read him the announcement
When he had given their shares to Zacharie, Étienne, and the.other mate who replaced Chaval, there would remain at most fifty francs.for himself, his father, Catherine, and Jeanlin..."No, no, I've made no mistake," replied the clerk
"There are two.Sundays and four rest days to be taken off; that makes nine days of.work." Maheu followed this calculation in a low voice: nine days gave.him about thirty francs, eighteen to Catherine, nine to Jeanlin
To think that he had once.brought back a fortnight's pay of full a hundred and fifty francs when.Father Bonnemort was working and Zacharie had not yet set up house for.himself!.."Well, are you going to take it?" cried the cashier impatiently
Toussaint Maheu, is it not? The general.secretary wishes to speak to you
Already there was not enough to.eat, and what would happen if wages were still further lowered? In the.estaminets the anger grew loud, and fury so dried their throats that.the little money taken went over the counters...From Montsou to the settlement Étienne and Maheu never exchanged.a word
Philoméne watched Maheu so that.Zacharie should not get hold of the money
But Mother Brulé thought this cowardly of her.son-in-law; she was among the enraged, lean and erect in the midst of.the group, with her fists stretched towards Montsou..."To think," she cried, without naming the Hennebeaus, "that this.morning I saw their servant go by in a carriage! Yes, the cook in.a carriage with two horses, going to Marchiennes to get fish, sure.enough!"..A clamour arose, and the abuse began again
Rasseneur no.longer struggled against it, and Souvarine accepted it as a first step..Étienne summed up the situation in a word: if the Company really wanted.a strike then the Company should have a strike......CHAPTER V...A week passed, and work went on suspiciously and mournfully in.expectation of the conflict...Among the Maheus the fortnight threatened to be more meagre than.ever
On Monday and Tuesday.Jeanlin, who was supposed to be quietly engaged on his task at the.Voreux, had escaped, to run away into the marshes and the forest of.Vandame with Bébert and Lydie
It was half-past two, and the men would soon have to ascend..Lying on his side, Étienne was finishing the cutting of a block, when a.distant growl of thunder shook the whole mine..."What's that, then?" he cried, putting down his axe to listen...He had at first thought that the gallery was falling in behind his back...But Maheu had already glided along the slope of the cutting, saying:.."It's a fall! Quick, quick!"..All tumbled down and hastened, carried away by an impulse of anxious.fraternity
With morbid precocity, he seemed to have the obscure.intelligence and the quick skill of a human abortion which had returned.to its animal ways...In the afternoon, Mouque brought Bataille, whose turn it was, to the.trammers; and as the horse was snuffing in the shunting, Jeanlin, who.had glided up to Bébert, asked him:.."What's the matter with the old hack to stop short like that? He'll.break my legs."..Bébert could not reply; he had to hold in Bataille, who was growing.lively at the approach of the other tram
So every time that.Bataille met him he put out his head snorting, and moistened him with.an encouraging caress..."By God!" swore Bébert, "there they are, licking each other's skins.again!"..Then, when Trompette had passed, he replied, on the subject of Bataille:.."Oh, he's a cunning old beast! When he stops like that it's because he.guesses there's something in the way, a stone or a hole, and he takes.care of himself; he doesn't want to break his bones
But.all hearts were contracted when a death-rattle was heard from the ruins...Bébert, leaving his tram, ran up, repeating:.."Jeanlin is underneath! Jeanlin is underneath!"..Maheu, at this very moment, had come out of the passage with Zacharie.and Étienne
He was seized with the fury of despair, and could only.utter oaths:.."My God! my God! my God!"..Catherine, Lydie, and Mouquette, who had also rushed up, began to sob.and shriek with terror in the midst of the fearful disorder, which was.increased by the darkness
The men tried to make them be silent, but.they shrieked louder as each groan was heard...The captain, Richomme, had come up running, in despair that neither.Négrel, the engineer, nor Dansaert was at the pit
Maheu had already.called Jeanlin twenty times over
The groaning alone replied..."Look sharp!" repeated Richomme, who had already organized a rescue,."we can talk afterwards."..From each end the miners attacked the landslip with pick and shovel..Chaval worked without a word beside Maheu and Étienne, while Zacharie.superintended the removal of the earth
But neither Catherine nor Mouquette, nor even.Lydie, would move, nailed to the spot with a desire to know what.had happened, and to help
In the first lay Chicot's corpse,.supported by Étienne; in the second, Maheu was seated with Jeanlin,.still unconscious, on his knees, covered by a strip of wool torn from.the ventilation door
In the.first Maheu remained with his wounded little one on his knees, while in.the other Étienne kept Chicot's corpse between his arms to hold it up..When the men had piled themselves up in the other decks the cage rose..It took two minutes
Maheu and Étienne alone entered
But the right leg gave him some anxiety,.it would probably have to be cut off...At this moment the engineer, Négrel, and Dansaert, who had been.informed, came up with Richomme
Vanderhaghen ordered Jeanlin's immediate removal to his parents'..Six o'clock struck, twilight was already coming on, and they would do.well to remove the corpse also; the engineer gave orders to harness.the van and to bring a stretcher
The first.November cold had denuded the immense plain; the night was now slowly.burying it like a shroud fallen from the livid sky...Étienne then in a low voice advised Maheu to send Catherine on to warn.Maheude so as to soften the blow
Then.someone was dead? Who was it? The story told by Levaque after first.reassuring them, now exaggerated their nightmare: it was not one man,.it was ten who had perished, and who were now being brought back in the.van one by one...Catherine found her mother agitated by a presentiment; and after.hearing the first stammered words Maheude cried:.."The father's dead!"..The young girl protested in vain, speaking of Jeanlin
"Would you rather he had remained below?"..But Maheude grew more furious, while Alzire, Lénore, and Henri were.crying around her
All the same their misery was aggravated, for the.father had received such a shock that he was seriously ill with fever...Since Thursday Maheu had been back at the pit and it was now Sunday..In the evening Étienne talked of the approaching date of the 1st.of December, preoccupied in wondering if the Company would execute.its threat
Étienne was long in going.to sleep, restless at the thought of that empty bed in which Alzire.occupied so little room...Next morning she was still absent; and it was only in the afternoon, on.returning from the pit, that the Maheus learnt that Chaval was keeping.Catherine
But Maheude did not.take things so easily..."Did I beat her when she took this Chaval?" she cried to Étienne, who.listened in silence, very pale
Lénore and Henri, overcome by this storm,.cried quietly, while the mother now enumerated their misfortunes: first.Zacharie who had had to get married; then old Bonnemort who was there.on his chair with his twisted feet; then Jeanlin who could not leave.the room for ten days with his badly-united bones; and now, as a last.blow, this jade Catherine, who had gone away with a man! The whole.family was breaking up
How.were they to live, seven persons without counting Estelle, on his three.francs? They might as well jump into the canal in a band..."It won't do any good to worry yourself," said Maheu in a low voice,."perhaps we have not got to the end."..Étienne, who was looking fixedly at the flags on the floor, raised his.head, and murmured with eyes lost in a vision of the future:.."Ah! it is time! it is time!".....PART FOUR.....CHAPTER I...On that Monday the Hennebeaus had invited the Grégoires and their.daughter Cécile to lunch
They had formed their plans: on rising from.table, Paul Négrel was to take the ladies to a mine, Saint-Thomas,.which had been luxuriously reinstalled
But this was only an amiable.pretext; this party was an invention of Madame Hennebeau's to hasten.the marriage of Cécile and Paul...Suddenly, on this very Monday, at four o'clock in the morning, the.strike broke out
There.was the Mirou, the Crévecoeur, the Madeleine, where only the grooms.had appeared; the Victoire and Feutry-Cantel, the two best disciplined.pits, where the men had been reduced by a third; Saint-Thomas alone.numbered all its people, and seemed to be outside the movement
He went up to Madame Hennebeau, whose hair had just been done.by her lady's maid, in her dressing-room..."Ah! they are on strike," she said quietly, when he had told her.."Well, what has that to do with us? We are not going to leave off.eating, I suppose?"..And she was obstinate; it was vain to tell her that the lunch would be.disturbed, and that the visit to Saint-Thomas could not take place..She found an answer to everything
But Paris only completed their separation,.that Paris which she had desired since her first doll, and where she.washed away her provincialism in a week, becoming a woman of fashion.at once, and throwing herself into all the luxurious follies of the.period
It was after the rupture, and when he saw that she was ill with.grief, that he had accepted the management of the Montsou mines, still.hoping also that she would reform down there in that desolate black.country...The Hennebeaus, since they had lived at Montsou, returned to the.irritated boredom of their early married days
At.the end of six months, when the house, being definitely furnished, no.longer occupied Madame Hennebeau, she fell into the languor of boredom,.a victim who was being killed by exile, and who said that she was glad.to die of it...Just then Paul Négrel arrived at Montsou
His mother, the widow of.a Provence captain, living at Avignon on a slender income, had had.to content herself with bread and water to enable him to reach the.École Polytechnique
He returned and sat before his desk, on which a.new packet of dispatches was placed...At eleven o'clock the Grégoires arrived, and were astonished when.Hippolyte, the footman, who was placed as sentinel, hustled them in.after an anxious glance at the two ends of the road
With a movement of her chin, Madame Grégoire.approved his confidence in the everlasting resignation of the colliers;.while Cécile, who was very cheerful that day, feeling that she looked.well in her capuchin cloth costume, smiled at the word "strike," which.reminded her of visits to the settlements and the distribution of.charities...Madame Hennebeau now appeared in black silk, followed by Négrel..."Ah! isn't it annoying!" she said, at the door
"As if they couldn't.wait, those men! You know that Paul refuses to take us to Saint-Thomas.".."We can stay here," said M
It is Monsieur Dansaert, who is in the hall
What do you think they can do.with that? I suspect a man called Étienne Lantier of being their.leader
Madame Grégoire expressed.pity for the poor people who would suffer from hunger; and Cécile was.already making plans for distributing gifts of bread and meat
Grégoire, in spite of everything and though still trembling, called.himself a Liberal and regretted Louis Philippe
All talked excitedly at the same time, while the servant.poured out Rhine wine in place of champagne which was looked upon as.commonplace...And the marriage of Paul and Cécile certainly made a forward step in.the sympathy produced by the dessert
"Let them wait."..He was nervous, listening to every sound, though apparently occupied.with his cup...Paul and Cécile got up, and he made her venture an eye to the keyhole..They were stifling their laughter and talking in a low voice..."Do you see them?".."Yes, I see a big man and two small ones behind.".."Haven't they ugly faces?".."Not at all; they are very nice."..Suddenly M
They all sat down again and remained at.table in silence, no longer daring to move, listening from afar with.intent ears jarred by these coarse male voices......CHAPTER II...The previous day, at a meeting held at Rasseneur's, Étienne and some.comrades had chosen the delegates who were to proceed on the following.day to the manager's house
They would have bread and.butter in the evening..."You know that we reckon on you to speak," said Étienne suddenly to.Maheu...The latter was so overcome that he was silent from emotion..."No, no! that's too much," cried Maheude
At first Étienne had arranged to speak,.but he had been at Montsou for too short a time
Lord! they have money, why should they care?"..There was silence again; Maheu and Étienne rose, and left the family.in gloom before the empty plates
They twisted their caps between.their fingers, and looked sideways at the furniture, which was in every.variety of style, as a result of the taste for the old-fashioned: Henry.II easy-chairs, Louis XV chairs, an Italian cabinet of the seventeenth.century, a Spanish contador of the fifteenth century, with an.altar-front serving as a chimney-piece, and ancient chasuble trimming.reapplied to the curtains
He had recognized Pierron, who was.hidden in the last row, and his eyes rested on Étienne who was seated.in front of him..."Well," he asked, "what have you to say to me?"..He had expected to hear the young man speak and he was so surprised to.see Maheu come forward that he could not avoid adding:.."What! you, a good workman who have always been so sensible, one of the.old Montsou people whose family has worked in the mine since the first.stroke of the axe! Ah! it's a pity, I'm sorry that you are at the head.of the discontented."..Maheu listened with his eyes down
Hennebeau and Étienne.as though the other miners were no longer there..."The Company is a Providence for the men, and you are wrong to threaten.it
Maheu was trying to find something to say before leaving, when.Étienne again touched his elbow
Paul reassured Cécile, stating that they were expecting the.police...At last Madame Hennebeau called the servant:.."Hippolyte, before we go into the drawing-room just open the windows.and let in a little air.".....CHAPTER III...A fortnight had passed, and on the Monday of the third week the lists.sent up to the managers showed a fresh decrease in the number of the.miners who had gone down
The Voreux, Crévecoeur, Mirou, and Madeleine.were not the only pits resting; at the Victoire and at Feutry-Cantel.only about a quarter of the men had gone down; even Saint-Thomas was.affected
He acted besides like a capricious tyrant,.giving or refusing bread according to the look of the girl who was.sent by her parents for provisions; and he especially closed his door.spitefully to Maheude, wishing to punish her because he had not been.able to get Catherine
As to the Pierrons, they always had money; but in order.to appear as needy as the others, for fear of loans, they got their.supplies on credit from Maigrat, who would have thrown his shop at.Pierronne if she had held out her petticoat to him
And his dream of popular leadership.again soothed him: Montsou at his feet, Paris in the misty distance,.who knows? The elections some day, the tribune in a gorgeous hall,.where he could thunder against the middle class in the first speech.pronounced by a workman in a parliament...During the last few days Étienne had been perplexed
Pluchart wrote.letter after letter, offering to come to Montsou to quicken the zeal.of the strikers
Étienne feared a.disturbance, but he would, however, have allowed Pluchart to come if.Rasseneur had not violently blamed this proceeding
In spite of his.power, the young man had to reckon with the innkeeper, whose services.were of older date, and who had faithful followers among his clients..So he still hesitated, not knowing what to reply...On this very Monday, towards four o'clock, a new letter came from Lille.as Étienne was alone with Maheude in the lower room
Seated near the.miserable fire, which they no longer dared to keep up, Maheude, with.her dress unbuttoned and one breast hanging out of her dress and.falling to her belly, was suckling Estelle...When the young man had folded the letter, she questioned him:.."Is the news good? Are they going to send us any money?"..He shook his head, and she went on:.."I don't know what we shall do this week
But she only saw pity in his constant.tenderness; he must feel contempt for her to gaze at her like that..Then her heart contracted so that she choked, without being able to.stammer any more words of excuse..."That's it, you'd best hold your tongue," began the implacable Maheude.."If you come back to stay, come in; else get along with you at once,.and think yourself lucky that I'm not free just now, or I should have.put my foot into you somewhere before now."..As if this threat had suddenly been realized, Catherine received a.vigorous kick right behind, so violent that she was stupefied with.surprise and pain
And it's you that pay him, eh?.You pour coffee down him with my money!"..Maheude and Étienne were stupefied, and did not stir
With a furious.movement Chaval chased Catherine towards the door..."Out you go, by God!"..And as she took refuge in a corner he turned on her mother..."A nice business, keeping watch while your whore of a daughter is.kicking her legs upstairs!"..At last he caught Catherine's wrist, shaking her and dragging her out..At the door he again turned towards Maheude, who was nailed to her.chair
Only I say things as they are, and I.know neighbours who couldn't say as much, don't you think?".."That's true enough," replied Étienne...And he rose and went out, while she decided to light the fire again,.after having placed the sleeping Estelle on two chairs
Then he left his mate to return alone to.the settlement, saying that he would follow him; and he entered and.sat down in the Avantage, awaiting the departure of a client to tell.Rasseneur decisively that he should write to Pluchart to come at once..His resolution was taken; he would organize a private meeting, for.victory seemed to him certain if the Montsou colliers adhered in a mass.to the International......CHAPTER IV...It was at the Bon-Joyeux, Widow Désir's, that the private meeting was.organized for Thursday at two o'clock
On the pavement at the Casimir Bar and.the Estaminet du Progrés one only saw the pale faces of the landladies,.looking inquiringly into the street; then in Montsou itself the.deserted doors extended from the Estaminet Lenfant to the Estaminet.Tison, passing by the Estaminet Piquette and the Tête-Coupée Bar; only.the Estaminet Saint-Éloi, which was frequented by captains, still drew.occasional glasses; the solitude even extended to the Volcan, where the.ladies were resting for lack of admirers, although they had lowered.their price from ten sous to five in view of the hard times
The.avowed order of the day was a discussion regarding the continuation of.the strike; but in reality they were expecting Pluchart, and reckoning.on a discourse from him which would cause a general adhesion to the.International...On Thursday morning Étienne was disquieted by the non-appearance of his.old foreman, who had promised by letter to arrive on Wednesday evening..What, then, was happening? He was annoyed that he would not be able to.come to an understanding with him before the meeting
At nine o'clock.he went to Montsou, with the idea that the mechanic had, perhaps, gone.there direct without stopping at the Voreux..."No, I've not seen your friend," replied Widow Désir
Yes, I think we ought to.manage our own affairs ourselves, without turning to strangers."..Étienne, losing his self-possession and trembling with anger, turned.his eyes on his mate's and stammered:.."You've done that, you've done that?".."I have done that, certainly! and you know that I trust Pluchart; he's.a knowing fellow and reliable, one can get on with him
He explained.it badly, however, in confused phrases which contained a little of.all the theories he had successively passed through and abandoned..At the summit Karl Marx's idea remained standing: capital was the.result of spoliation, it was the duty and the privilege of labour.to reconquer that stolen wealth
The two men no longer shouted, having.become bitter and spiteful, conquered by the coldness of their rivalry..It was at bottom that which always strains systems, making one man.revolutionary in the extreme, pushing the other to an affectation of.prudence, carrying them, in spite of themselves, beyond their true.ideas into those fatal parts which men do not choose for themselves..And Souvarine, who was listening, exhibited on his pale, girlish face.a silent contempt--the crushing contempt of the man who was willing.to yield his life in obscurity without even gaining the splendour of.martyrdom..."Then it's to me that you're saying that?" asked Étienne; "you're.jealous!".."Jealous of what?" replied Rasseneur
The other man looked.at him in fear, and thought of the stories of which he had received.vague intimation, of mines charged beneath the tsar's palace, of chiefs.of police struck down by knives like wild boars, of his mistress, the.only woman he had loved, hanged at Moscow one rainy morning, while in.the crowd he kissed her with his eyes for the last time..."No! no!" murmured Étienne, as with a gesture he pushed away these.abominable visions, "we haven't got to that yet over here
We like to know where we are going to."..Then Souvarine concluded peacefully, with his gaze fixed on space:.."All reasoning about the future is criminal, because it prevents pure.destruction, and interferes with the progress of revolution."..This made Étienne laugh, in spite of the cold shiver which passed over.his flesh
This provoking.calmness still further disturbed Étienne, all the more as many had come.merely for fun--Zacharie, Mouquet, and others
We should have been in a fine.fix!"..He went back to the cab, which the cabman drew up again, and he pulled.out a little black wooden box, which he carried off under his arm...Étienne walked radiantly in his shadow, while Rasseneur, in.consternation, did not dare to offer his hand
Maheu and Levaque, who.had arrived late, followed them
This made the jokers laugh even more, Zacharie shouting.to Mouquet that perhaps they were going to get them all with child in.there...About a hundred miners were waiting on the benches in the close air of.the room, with the warm odours of the last ball rising from the floor..Whispers ran round and all heads turned, while the new-comers sat down.in the empty places
He.gave out the names, while the others approved by lifting their hands..Pluchart was nominated chairman, and Maheu and Étienne himself were.voted stewards
"When one talks one gets thirsty."..Maheu relieved her of the tray and Pluchart was able to go on
He said.how very touched he was at his reception by the Montsou workers, he.excused himself for his delay, mentioning his fatigue and his sore.throat, then he gave place to Citizen Rasseneur, who wished to speak...Rasseneur had already planted himself beside the table near the.glasses
The voting was decided in.advance..."You don't care a damn, you don't! you can eat!" yelled Levaque,.thrusting out his fist at Rasseneur...Étienne leaned over behind the chairman's back to appease Maheu, who.was very red, and carried out of himself by this hypocritical discourse..."Citizens!" said Pluchart, "allow me to speak!"..There was deep silence
And in.this case he showed the International as providence for strikers, and.quoted examples: in Paris, during the strike of the bronze-workers, the.masters had granted everything at once, terrified at the news that the.International was sending help; in London it had saved the miners at a.colliery, by sending back, at its own expense, a ship-load of Belgians.who had been brought over by the coal-owner
Étienne, after having.seized the little box, waited with Pluchart and Maheu, who considered.it a point of honour to emerge last
And he then went away with his.four gendarmes to prepare a report, beneath the jeers of Zacharie and.Mouquet, who were full of admiration for the way in which their mates.had humbugged this armed force, for which they themselves did not care.a hang...In the alley outside, Étienne, embarrassed by the box, was rushing.along, followed by the others
They.wished to retain Pluchart, but, without stopping, he declared that.he must set out at once for Joiselle, where Legoujeux was awaiting.orders
A few words were exchanged, broken by the panting of their chests..Étienne and Maheu were laughing confidently, henceforth certain of.victory
For a moment they thought themselves saved, for the small.retail shopkeepers of Montsou, killed out by Maigrat, had offered.credit to try and get back their custom; and for a week Verdonck, the.grocer, and the two bakers, Carouble and Smelten, kept open shop, but.when their advances were exhausted all three stopped
When she had eaten she went away dazed...Étienne stood in the open field of Réquillart, where the crumbling.sheds were disappearing beneath the brambles..."Well, won't you come in and drink a little glass?" asked Mouquette.merrily...And as he hesitated:.."Then you're still afraid of me?"..He followed her, won by her laughter
Were they making fun of people? More credit!.Then they wanted to turn him into the street? No, not a single potato,.not a single crumb of bread! And he told them to be off to the grocer.Verdonck, and to the bakers Carouble and Smelten, since they now dealt.with them
And the livid twilight now coming on seemed to.increase the cold..."What's to be done?" repeated Maheude, crouching down in the corner by.the oven...Étienne stood up, looking at the portraits of the Emperor and Empress.stuck against the wall
I don't know what he's up to; the rascal.always looks as though his belly were full.".."Perhaps," said Étienne, "he picks up sous on the road."..She suddenly lifted both fists furiously..."If I knew that! My children beg! I'd rather kill them and myself too."..Maheu had again sunk down on the edge of the table
Ah! whatever people.might say, when a woman behaved ill, that brought luck to her house..."Good night," she said, suddenly...Outside night had come on, and the moon behind the clouds was lighting.up the earth with a dubious glow
A.gleam of hope made her hasten, for she had recognized the Montsou.priest, Abbé Joire, who said mass on Sundays at the settlement chapel..No doubt he had just come out of the sacristy, where he had been called.to settle some affair
The minutes went by, and at last they no longer.reckoned on this...When Étienne reappeared, he held a cloth containing a dozen potatoes,.cooked but cold..."That's all that I've found," he said...With Mouquette also bread was wanting; it was her dinner which she had.forced him to take in this cloth, kissing him with all her heart..."Thanks," he said to Maheude, who offered him his share; "I've eaten.over there."..It was not true, and he gloomily watched the children throw themselves.on the food
The little ones were crying......CHAPTER VI...Jeanlin was now well and able to walk; but his legs had united so badly.that he limped on both the right and left sides, and moved with the.gait of a duck, though running as fast as formerly with the skill of a.mischievous and thieving animal...On this evening, in the dusk on the Réquillart road, Jeanlin,.accompanied by his inseparable friends, Bébert and Lydie, was on the.watch
Mouquet proposed a game of crosse for the next day; they.would leave the Avantage at two o'clock, and go to the Montoire side,.near Marchiennes
Soon the immense plain belonged to them...What drove them thus from Montsou to Marchiennes, constantly on the.roads with the eyes of young wolves, was the growing love of plunder..Jeanlin remained the captain of these expeditions, leading the troop.on to all sorts of prey, ravaging the onion fields, pillaging the.orchards, attacking shop windows
The worst was that he always gave himself the lion's share..Bébert also had to bring him the booty, happy if the captain did not.hit him and keep it all...For some time Jeanlin had abused his authority
He would beat Lydie as.one beats one's lawful wife, and he profited by Bébert's credulity to.send him on unpleasant adventures, amused at making a fool of this big.boy, who was stronger than himself, and could have knocked him over.with a blow of his fist
But first he.would pocket the booty...This was what happened on the present occasion..."Give it up," he said, snatching the cod from his mate's hands when.they stopped, all three, at a bend in the road near Réquillart...Bébert protested..."I want some, you know
And then you will.go straight back, and if Bébert touches Lydie on the way, I shall know.it and I shall hit you."..Then he disappeared in the shadow, so lightly that the sound of his.naked feet could not be heard
When they went away, although the night was very.dark, they did not even kiss each other; they walked side by side,.tender and despairing, certain that if they touched one another the.captain would strike them from behind...Étienne, at the same hour, had entered Réquillart
This one simply bore the.word "Amour.".."You have a fine knife," remarked Étienne..."It's a present from Lydie," replied Jeanlin, who neglected to add.that Lydie had stolen it, by his orders, from a huckster at Montsou,.stationed before the Tête-Coupée Bar...Then, as he still scraped, he added proudly:.."Isn't it comfortable in my house? It's a bit warmer than up above, and.it feels a lot better!"..Étienne had seated himself, and was amused in making him talk
And there were flights of white butterflies, snowy.flies and spiders, a decolorized population for ever ignorant of the.sun..."Then you're not afraid?" asked Étienne...Jeanlin looked at him in astonishment..."Afraid of what? I am quite alone."..But the cod was at last scraped
The mine which had made.him had just finished him by breaking his legs..."And Lydie?" asked Étienne again; "do you bring her here sometimes?"..Jeanlin laughed contemptuously..."The little one? Ah, no, not I; women blab."..And he went on laughing, filled with immense disdain for Lydie and.Bébert
They had gradually reached the first houses of.Montsou, and were standing with their arms round one another beneath a.large round moon, when a woman passed near them with a sudden start, as.though she had knocked against a stone..."Who is that?" asked Étienne, anxiously..."It's Catherine," replied Mouquette
Jeanlin had gone off at one o'clock, but.he had to wait for Bébert behind the church, and they nearly set out.without Lydie, whose mother had again shut her up in the cellar, and.only now liberated her to put a basket on her arm, telling her that.if she did not bring it back full of dandelions she should be shut up.with the rats all night long
With a leap he seized her by the ears,.stuffed her into the little girl's basket, and all three rushed away..They would amuse themselves finely by making her run like a dog as far.as the forest...But they stopped to gaze at Zacharie and Mouquet, who, after having.drunk a glass with two other mates, had begun their big game of.crosse
And the game went on, backwards and forwards, always.running, their feet bruised by the frozen ridges of the ploughed fields...At first Jeanlin, Bébert, and Lydie had trotted behind the players,.delighted with their vigorous strokes
From the Paillot farm they had gone off to the Quatre-Chemins,.then from the Quatre-Chemins to Montoire; and now they were going in.six strokes from Montoire to Pré-des-Vaches
That made two leagues and.a half in an hour; and, besides, they had had drinks at the Estaminet.Vincent and at the Trois-Sages Bar
All four shouted; the party was.excited, for they were neck to neck; it was necessary to begin again..From the Pré-des-Vaches it was not two kilometres to the point of.Herbes-Rousses, in five strokes
She was moaning when they quickly put her back into.the basket, near the wood at Cruchot, on hearing the players whose game.they had once more came across...Zacharie, Mouquet, and the two others were getting over the kilometres,.with no other rest than the time for a drink at all the inns which they.had fixed on as their goals
From the Herbes-Rousses they had gone on.to Buchy, then to Croix-de-Pierre, then to Chamblay
As to Jeanlin, ever since leaving the settlement he had.been aiming at the forest, though apparently only scouring the fields..With an indignant gesture he threatened Lydie, who was full of remorse.and fear, and talked of going back to the Voreux to gather dandelions..Were they going to abandon the meeting? he wanted to know what the old.people would say
He pushed Bébert, and proposed to enliven the end of.the journey as far as the trees by detaching Poland and pursuing her.with stones
Almost at the.same minute Zacharie, Mouquet, and the two others, with their last blow.at crosse, drove the ball within a few metres of the glade
A rumbling arose from them, like that of a storm,.in this motionless and frozen forest...At the top, dominating the slope, Étienne stood with Rasseneur and.Maheu
Then behind were the chaffers, Zacharie, Mouquet, and.others who had come to make fun of the thing; while gathered together.in a very different spirit the women in a group were as serious as.if at church
And Jeanlin had planted himself on the pile of wood,.hoisting up Lydie and making Bébert follow him, all three higher up in.the air than any one else...The quarrel was raised by Rasseneur, who wished to proceed formally.to the election of officers
He was enraged by his defeat at the.Bon-Joyeux, and had sworn to have his revenge, for he flattered himself.that he could regain his old authority when he was once face to face,.not with the delegates, but with the miners themselves
Many obscure phrases had escaped.them, they could not properly understand this technical and abstract.reasoning; but the very obscurity and abstraction still further.enlarged the field of promises and lifted them into a dazzling region..What a dream! to be masters, to suffer no more, to enjoy at last!.."That's it, by God! it's our turn now! Down with the exploiters."..The women were delirious; Maheude, losing her calmness, was seized.with the vertigo of hunger, the Levaque woman shouted, old Brulé,.carried out of herself, was brandishing her witch-like arms, Philoméne.was shaken by a spasm of coughing, and Mouquette was so excited that.she cried out words of tenderness to the orator
Among the men,.Maheu was won over and shouted with anger, between Pierron who was.trembling and Levaque who was talking too much; while the chaffers,.Zacharie and Mouquet, though trying to make fun of things, were feeling.uncomfortable and were surprised that their mate could talk on so long.without having a drink
But on top of the pile of wood, Jeanlin was.making more noise than any one, egging on Bébert and Lydie and shaking.the basket in which Poland lay...The clamour began again
As to Rasseneur, he shrugged his shoulders with.contempt and anger..."You shall let me speak," he shouted to Étienne...The latter jumped from the tree-trunk..."Speak, we shall see if they'll hear you."..Already Rasseneur had replaced him, and with a gesture demanded.silence
To the pits! to the pits!"..While he was speaking Étienne had looked for Catherine among the pale.shouting heads before him
You work at Jean-Bart."..A chaffing voice interrupted:.."Oh! he work! he's got a wife who works for him."..Chaval swore, while the blood rose to his face..."By God! is it forbidden to work, then?".."Yes!" said Étienne, "when your mates are enduring misery for the good.of all, it is forbidden to go over, like a selfish sneaking coward,.to the masters' side
Do you understand? there are only traitors in the Jean Bart.cuttings; you're all traitors!"..The crowd around Chaval grew threatening, and fists were raised and.cries of "Kill him! kill him!" began to be uttered
The frozen moss crackled beneath the heels of the.crowd, while the beeches, erect in their strength, with the delicate.tracery of their black branches against the white sky, neither saw nor.heard the miserable beings who writhed at their feet...There was some pushing, and Maheude found herself near Maheu
The Levaque,.with her fists to her hips, was setting to with Philoméne, whom she.accused of having laughed; Mouquette talked of attacking the gendarmes.by kicking them somewhere; Mother Brulé, who had just slapped Lydie on.finding her without either basket or salad, went on launching blows.into space against all the masters whom she would like to have got at..For a moment Jeanlin was in terror, Bébert having learned through a.trammer that Madame Rasseneur had seen them steal Poland; but when he.had decided to go back and quietly release the beast at the door of.the Avantage, he shouted louder than ever, and opened his new knife,.brandishing the blade and proud of its glitter..."Mates! mates!" repeated the exhausted Étienne, hoarse with the effort.to obtain a moment's silence for a definite understanding...At last they listened..."Mates! to-morrow morning at Jean-Bart, is it agreed?".."Yes! yes! at Jean-Bart! death to the traitors!"..The tempest of these three thousand voices filled the sky, and died.away in the pure brightness of the moon......PART FIVE.....CHAPTER I...At four o'clock the moon had set, and the night was very dark..Everything was still asleep at Deneulin's; the old brick house stood.mute and gloomy, with closed doors and windows, at the end of the large.ill-kept garden which separated it from the Jean-Bart mine
But from the other side of the staircase.alarmed voices were whispering; and when he came out he saw his.daughters' door open, and they both appeared in white dressing-gowns,.slipped on in haste..."Father, what is it?"..Lucie, the elder, was already twenty-two, a tall dark girl, with a.haughty air; while Jeanne, the younger, as yet scarcely nineteen years.old, was small, with golden hair and a certain caressing grace..."Nothing serious," he replied, to reassure them
Today, with their boyish.and artistic demeanour, they kept the purse, were careful over sous,.haggled with the tradesmen, renovated their dresses unceasingly, and in.fact, succeeded in rendering decent the growing embarrassment of the.house..."Eat, papa," repeated Lucie...Then, remarking his silent gloomy preoccupation, she was again.frightened..."Is it serious, then, that you look at us like this? Tell us; we will.stay with you, and they can do without us at that lunch."..She was speaking of a party which had been planned for the morning,.Madame Hennebeau was to go in her carriage, first for Cécile, at.the Grégoires', then to call for them, so that they could all go to.Marchiennes to lunch at the Forges, where the manager's wife had.invited them
He pushed a little.door: the buildings of the pit could be divined in the black night, by.the deepening of the shadow, starred by a few lanterns...Jean-Bart was not so important as the Voreux, but its renewed.installation made it a pretty pit, as the engineers say
The pump was placed on the other shaft of the.concession, the old Gaston-Marie pit, reserved solely for this purpose..Jean-Bart, to right and left of the winding-shaft, only had two.conduits, that for the steam ventilator and that for the ladders...In the morning, ever since three o'clock, Chaval, who had arrived.first, had been seducing his comrades, convincing them that they ought.to imitate those at Montsou, and demand an increase of five centimes.a tram
"Will you just go down and not.laze about!"..At nine o'clock, when Madame Hennebeau arrived in her carriage with.Cécile, she found Lucie and Jeanne quite ready and very elegant, in.spite of their dresses having been renovated for the twentieth time..But Deneulin was surprised to see Négrel accompanying the carriage on.horseback
Madame Grégoire has also.promised to come for Cécile.".."You may reckon on me," replied Deneulin...The carriage went off towards Vandame, Jeanne and Lucie leaning down.to laugh once more to their father, who was standing by the roadside;.while Négrel gallantly trotted behind the fleeing wheels...They crossed the forest, taking the road from Vandame to Marchiennes..As they approached Tartaret, Jeanne asked Madame Hennebeau if she knew.Côte-Verte, and the latter, in spite of her stay of five years in.the country, acknowledged that she had never been on that side
And like a miracle of eternal.spring, in the midst of this accursed moor of Tartaret, Côte-Verte.appeared, with its meadows for ever green, its beeches with leaves.unceasingly renewed, its fields where three harvests ripened
They were by the side of old workings, a.very deep abandoned gallery of Gaston-Marie, where, ten years earlier,.an explosion of fire-damp had set the seam alight; and it was still.burning behind the clay wall which had been built there and was kept.constantly repaired, in order to limit the disaster
He was at a square in the great haulage gallery which formerly.led to Gaston-Marie
Why cut the cables? And who was.cutting them, when the men were below? It seemed monstrous...But the voice of another captain was heard and then lost:.."The Montsou men are cutting the cables! Let every one go up!"..When he had understood, Chaval stopped Catherine short
For a moment he thought of retracing his path.and ascending through Gaston-Marie, but that was no longer possible
They threw themselves toward the shaft, they crushed through.the narrow door to the ladder passage; while an old groom who had.prudently led back the horses to the stable, looked at them with an air.of contemptuous indifference, accustomed to spend nights in the pit and.certain that he could eventually be drawn out of it..."By God! will you climb up in front of me?" said Chaval to Catherine.."At least I can hold you if you fall."..Out of breath, and suffocated by this race of three kilometres which.had once more bathed her in sweat, she gave herself up, without.understanding, to the eddies of the crowd
As Étienne left the house he saw Rasseneur, seated before the.metal stove and looking very pale, while his wife, in her everlasting.black dress, was abusing him in polite and cutting terms...Maheu was of opinion that they ought to keep their promise
Jeanlin had.disappeared long ago
Maheu and Maheude went off on the side sloping.towards Montsou; while Étienne turned towards the forest, where he.proposed to join his mates
On the way he caught up a band of women.among whom he recognized Mother Brulé and the Levaque woman; as they.walked they were eating chestnuts which Mouquette had brought; they.swallowed the skins so as to feel more in their stomachs
Étienne perceived.Jeanlin, who had climbed up on a foot-bridge, installed as though at.a theatre
Maheu had to hold back Levaque,.who was pushing forward in a threatening manner, while Étienne went on.discussing, and tried to convince Deneulin of the lawfulness of their.revolutionary conduct
In less than five minutes the.whole pit belonged to them; they swarmed at every story in the midst.of furious gestures and cries, carried away by their victory over this.master who resisted...Maheu, in terror, had rushed forward among the first, saying to Étienne:.."They must not kill him!"..The latter was already running; then, when Étienne understood that.Deneulin had barricaded himself in the captains' room, he replied:.."Well, would it be our fault? such a madman!"..He was feeling anxious, however, being still too calm to yield to this.outburst of anger
"Put out the fires!"..Levaque, who had found a file, was brandishing it like a dagger,.dominating the tumult with a terrible cry:.."Cut the cables! cut the cables!"..Soon they all repeated this; only Étienne and Maheu continued to.protest, dazed, and talking in the tumult without obtaining silence
In the first rank Maheu felt a.fierce joy possess him, as if the teeth of the file would deliver.them from misfortune by eating into the cable of one of these dens of.wretchedness, into which they would never descend again...But Mother Brulé had disappeared by the shed stairs still shouting:.."The fires must be put out! To the boilers! to the boilers!"..Some women followed her
The piles of coal increased, and the burning heat cracked the.ceiling of the vast hall..."Enough, now!" cried Maheude; "the store-room is afire.".."So much the better," replied Mother Brulé
Men went down with hammers, even.the women armed themselves with iron bars; and they talked of smashing.boilers, of breaking engines, and of demolishing the mine...Étienne, forewarned, hastened to come up with Maheu
Catherine, bewildered, also.put on her sabots, buttoning at her neck her man's old jacket, with.which she kept off the cold; and she ran behind her lover, she would.not leave him, for surely they were going to murder him...Then in two minutes Jean-Bart was emptied
And in this certainty of.disaster he no longer felt any hatred of the Montsou brigands; he felt.that all had a complicity in it, that it was a general agelong fault..They were brutes, no doubt, but brutes who could not read, and who were.dying of hunger......CHAPTER IV...And the troop went off over the flat plain, white with frost beneath.the pale winter sun, and overflowed the path as they passed through the.beetroot fields...From the Fourche-aux-Boeufs, Étienne had assumed command
Then.the women came in the first ranks, some of them armed with sticks:.Maheude, with wild eyes seemed to be seeking afar for the promised.city of justice, Mother Brulé, the Levaque woman, Mouquette, striding.along beneath their rags, like soldiers setting out for the seat of.war
Étienne,.in the middle, kept Chaval in sight, forcing him to walk before him;.while Maheu, behind, gloomily kept an eye on Catherine, the only woman.among these men, obstinately trotting near her lover for fear that he.would be hurt
He kept his head,.however, and still wished to avoid needless destruction...As they arrived at the Joiselle road a Vandame pikeman, who had joined.the band for revenge on his master, impelled the men towards the right,.shouting:.."To Gaston-Marie! Must stop the pump! Let the water ruin Jean-Bart!"..The mob was already turning, in spite of the protests of Étienne,.who begged them to let the pumping continue
But the pikeman still shouted his cry of vengeance, and.Étienne had to cry still louder:.."To Mirou! There are traitors down there! To Mirou! to Mirou!"..With a gesture, he had turned the crowd towards the left road; while.Jeanlin, going ahead, was blowing louder than ever
An eddy was.produced in the crowd; this time Gaston-Marie was saved...And the four kilometres which separated them from Mirou were traversed.in half an hour, almost at running pace, across the interminable plain..The canal on this side cut it with a long icy ribbon
Then they let her be...The mob crossed the Joiselle road, went a short distance up the Cron.road and then mounted towards Cougny
At the boilers a tap was.broken; while the water, thrown by bucketsful into the stoves, made the.metal gratings burst...Outside they were talking of marching on Saint-Thomas
Why.had they not come across any soldiers? This impunity troubled them, at.the thought of the repression which they felt to be coming...Without any one knowing where it came from, a new word of command.turned them towards another pit..."To the Victoire! to the Victoire!"..Were there, then, neither soldiers nor police at the Victoire? Nobody.knew
And turning round they descended from the.Beaumont side and cut across the fields to reach the Joiselle road
He swore, and men ran to seize the fugitive, who.was hiding with Catherine behind the timber supply..."Ah! you dirty swine; you are afraid of getting into trouble!" shouted.Étienne
"It was you in the forest who called for a strike of the.engine-men, to stop the pumps, and now you want to play us a filthy.trick! Very well! By God! we will go back to Gaston-Marie
I will have.you smash the pump; yes, by God! you shall smash it!"..He was drunk; he was urging his men against this pump which he had.saved a few hours earlier..."To Gaston-Marie! to Gaston-Marie!"..They all cheered, and rushed on, while Chaval, seized by the shoulders,.was drawn and pushed violently along, while he constantly asked to be.allowed to wash..."Will you take yourself off, then?" cried Maheu to Catherine who had.also begun to run again...This time she did not even draw back, but turned her burning eyes on.her father, and went on running...Once more the mob ploughed through the flat plain
It was four o'clock; the sun which approached the horizon,.lengthened the shadows of this horde with their furious gestures over.the frozen soil...They avoided Montsou, and farther on rejoined the Joiselle road; to.spare the journey round Fourche-aux-Boeufs, they passed beneath the.walls of Piolaine
The Grégoires had just gone out, having to visit a.lawyer before going to dine with the Hennebeaus, where they would find.Cécile
It was a joke of Jeanlin's; he had manufactured a.sling with a piece of cord, and had just sent a little passing greeting.to the Grégoires
Already he was again blowing his horn, the band was.lost in the distance, and the cry grew fainter:.."Bread! bread! bread!"..They arrived at Gaston-Marie in still greater numbers, more than two.thousand five hundred madmen, breaking everything, sweeping away.everything, with the force of a torrent which gains strength as it.moves
The police had passed here an hour earlier, and had gone off.towards Saint-Thomas, led astray by some peasants; in their haste they.had not even taken the precaution of leaving a few men behind to guard.the pit
It.was white with a thick layer of ice; and they struck it and broke the.ice, forcing him to dip his head in this cold water..."Duck then," repeated Mother Brulé
He was haggard, stumbling, and with struggling.movements of his hips he tried to flee...Maheu had pushed him, and Maheude was among those who grew furious,.both of them satisfying their old spite; even Mouquette, who generally.remained such good friends with her old lovers, was wild with this one,.treating him as a good-for-nothing, and talking of taking his breeches.down to see if he was still a man...Étienne made her hold her tongue..."That's enough
On this day the.coachman was driving his wife; Rose, the new housemaid, had leave to.go out till five o'clock; there only remained Hippolyte, the valet de.chambre, trailing about the rooms in slippers, and the cook, who had.been occupied since dawn in struggling with her saucepans, entirely.absorbed in the dinner which was to be given in the evening
So M..Hennebeau promised himself a day of serious work in this deep calm of.the deserted house...Towards nine o'clock, although he had received orders to send every.one away, Hippolyte took the liberty of announcing Dansaert, who.was bringing news
The.sudden idea of the marriage between Cécile and Paul, which she was.arranging with so quiet a smile, completed his exasperation
Whom would she.devour, on whom would she fall, when she no longer had complaisant.nephews, sufficiently practical to accept in their own family the.table, the bed, and the wife?..There was a timid scratch at the door, and Hippolyte allowed himself to.whisper through the keyhole:.."The postman, sir
And Monsieur Dansaert, too, has come back, saying.that they are killing one another.".."I'm coming down, good God!"..What should he do to them? Chase them away on their return from.Marchiennes, like stinking animals whom he would no longer have.beneath his roof? He would take a cudgel, and would tell them to carry.elsewhere their poisonous coupling
He thus followed the mob from.afar, from Madeleine to Crévecoeur, from Crévecoeur to the Victoire,.from the Victoire to Gaston-Marie
But the tumult increased, and a terrible cry broke out just as he.was going to the window:.."Bread! bread! bread!"..It was the strikers, now invading Montsou, while the police, expecting.an attack on the Voreux, were galloping off in the opposite direction.to occupy that pit...Just then, two kilometres away from the first houses, a little beyond.the crossways where the main road cut the Vandame road, Madame.Hennebeau and the young ladies had witnessed the passing of the mob..The day had been spent pleasantly at Marchiennes; there had been a.delightful lunch with the manager of the Forges, then an interesting.visit to the workshops and to the neighbouring glass works to occupy.the afternoon; and as they were now going home in the limpid decline.of the beautiful winter day, Cécile had had the whim to drink a glass.of milk, as she noticed a little farm near the edge of the road
Seems things are not going well; they're masters.of the country."..She uttered every word prudently, watching the effect on their faces;.and when she noticed the fright of all of them, and their deep anxiety.at this encounter, she hastened to conclude:.."Oh, the rascals! the rascals!"..Négrel, seeing that it was too late to get into their carriage and.reach Montsou, ordered the coachman to bring the vehicle into the.farmyard, where it would remain hidden behind a shed
The noise grew louder, but nothing.could yet be seen; along the vacant road the wind of a tempest seemed.to be blowing, like those sudden gusts which precede great storms..."No, no! I don't want to look," said Cécile, going to hide herself in.the hay...Madame Hennebeau, who was very pale and felt angry with these people.who had spoilt her pleasure, stood in the background with a sidelong.look of repugnance; while Lucie and Jeanne, though trembling, had.placed their eyes at a crack, anxious to lose nothing of the spectacle...A sound of thunder came near, the earth was shaken, and Jeanlin.galloped up first, blowing into his horn..."Take out your scent-bottles, the sweat of the people is passing by!".murmured Négrel, who, in spite of his republican convictions, liked to.make fun of the populace when he was with ladies...But this witticism was carried away in the hurricane of gestures.and cries
Above their.heads, amid the bristling iron bars, an axe passed by, carried erect;.and this single axe, which seemed to be the standard of the band,.showed in the clear air the sharp profile of a guillotine-blade..."What atrocious faces!" stammered Madame Hennebeau...Négrel said between his teeth:.."Devil take me if I can recognize one of them! Where do the bandits.spring from?"..And in fact anger, hunger, these two months of suffering and this.enraged helter-skelter through the pits had lengthened the placid.faces of the Montsou colliers into the muzzles of wild beasts
The road seemed to be full of blood;.men and women continued to rush by, bloody as butchers in the midst of.slaughter..."Oh! superb!" whispered Lucie and Jeanne, stirred in their artistic.tastes by the beautiful horror of it...They were frightened, however, and drew back close to Madame Hennebeau,.who was leaning on a trough
Yes, it.was these things which were passing along the road; it was the force.of nature herself, and they were receiving the terrible wind of it in.their faces...A great cry arose, dominating the _Marseillaise_:.."Bread! bread! bread!"..Lucie and Jeanne pressed themselves against Madame Hennebeau, who was.almost fainting; while Négrel placed himself before them as though.to protect them by his body
How can you do good to.such creatures?"..Lucie and Jeanne were occupied in pulling Cécile out of the hay
It then occurred to Négrel, who had.remounted, that they might go through the Réquillart lanes..."Go gently," he said to the coachman, "for the road is atrocious
With no anger now against these starving people, only.enraged by the burning wound at his heart he continued to stammer in.the midst of his tears:.."Idiots! idiots!"..But the cry of the belly dominated, and a roar blew like a tempest,.sweeping everything before it:.."Bread! bread! bread!".....CHAPTER VI...Sobered by Catherine's blows, Étienne had remained at the head of his.mates
As he thus stood.alone, powerless, in the middle of the road, he was called by a man.standing on the threshold of the Estaminet Tison, where the landlady.had just put up the shutters in haste, leaving only the door free..."Yes, it's me
Zacharie occupied a table.with his wife, Philoméne
No one was drinking, they had.simply taken shelter...Étienne recognized Rasseneur and was turning away, when the latter.added:.."You don't want to see me, eh? I warned you, things are getting.awkward
Now you may ask for bread, they'll give you lead."..Then Étienne came back and replied:.."What troubles me is, the cowards who fold their arms and watch us.risking our skins.".."Your notion, then, is to pillage over there?" asked Rasseneur..."My notion is to remain to the last with our friends, quit by dying.together."..In despair, Étienne went back into the crowd, ready to die
On the.road, three children were throwing stones, and he gave them a good.kick, shouting out to his comrades that it was no good breaking windows...Bébert and Lydie, who had rejoined Jeanlin, were learning from him how.to work the sling
The women,.especially, terrified him--the Levaque, Mouquette, and the others--who.were agitated by murderous fury, with teeth and nails out, barking like.bitches, and driven on by Mother Brulé, whose lean figure dominated.them...But there was a sudden stop; a moment's surprise brought a little of.that calmness which Étienne's supplications could not obtain
Just then, Rose, the housemaid, was returning,.laughing at the furious workmen, all of whom she knew, for she belonged.to Montsou
M..Hennebeau spoke of going out to chase away the brawlers by himself, and.to meet the carriage, when Hippolyte appeared, exclaiming:.."Sir! sir, here is madame! They are killing madame!"..The carriage had not been able to pass through the threatening groups.in the Réquillart lane
At this moment the confusion was so great that.it led to one of those curious mistakes which can never be explained..Lucie and Jeanne reached the steps, and slipped in through the door,.which the housemaid opened; Madame Hennebeau had succeeded in following.them, and behind them Négrel at last came in, and then bolted the door,.feeling sure that he had seen Cécile go in first
She smelled of perfume, she wore a watch, she had the.delicate skin of a lazy woman who had never touched coal..."Stop!" shouted Mother Brulé, "we'll put it on your arse, that lace!".."The lazy sluts steal it from us," said the Levaque
"Uncover her arse! out with her arse!"..In the villa, as soon as they had realized the mishap, Négrel and M..Hennebeau bravely reopened the door to run to Cécile's help
A struggle took place here, while the Grégoires in terror.stood on the steps..."Let her be then, old man! It's the Piolaine young lady," cried Maheude.to the grandfather, recognizing Cécile, whose veil had been torn off by.one of the women...On his side, Étienne, overwhelmed at this retaliation on a child, was.trying to force the band to let go their prey
An inspiration came to.him; he brandished the axe, which he had snatched from Levaque's hands..."To Maigrat's house, by God! there's bread in there! Down to the earth.with Maigrat's damned shed!"..And at random he gave the first blow of the axe against the shop door..Some comrades had followed him--Levaque, Maheu, and a few others
But.the women were furious, and Cécile had fallen from Bonnemort's fingers.into Mother Brulé's hands
Lydie and Bébert, led by Jeanlin, had.slipped on all fours between her petticoats to see the lady's bottom..Already the women were pulling her about; her clothes were beginning.to split, when a man on horseback appeared, pushing on his animal, and.using his riding-whip on those who would not stand back quick enough..."Ah! rascals! You are going to flog our daughters, are you?"..It was Deneulin who had come to the rendezvous for dinner
And while.the young man at last led in the fainting Cécile, Deneulin protected.the manager with his tall body, and at the top of the steps received a.stone which nearly put his shoulder out..."That's it," he cried; "break my bones now you've broken my engines!"..He promptly pushed the door to, and a volley of flints fell against it..."What madmen!" he exclaimed
Grégoire's ideas were altogether.upset: they were murdering his daughter, they were razing his house to.the ground; it was, then, true that these miners could bear him ill.will, because he lived like a worthy man on their labour?..The housemaid, who had brought in a towel and some eau-de-Cologne,.repeated:.."All the same it's queer, they're not bad-hearted."..Madame Hennebeau, seated and very pale, had not recovered from the.shock to her feelings; and she was only able to find a smile when.Négrel was complimented
"I had guessed as.much; he must be in it."..It was not Rasseneur, however, it was Étienne, who was dealing blows.from his axe at Maigrat's shop
Such furious thrusts were made at the door that at every.stroke of the axe Étienne feared to wound someone...Meanwhile Maigrat, who had left the hall of the manager's house, had.at first taken refuge in the kitchen; but, hearing nothing there, he.imagined some abominable attempt against his shop, and came up again.to hide behind the pump outside, when he distinctly heard the cracking.of the door and shouts of pillage in which his own name was mixed
Maheu, Levaque, and the others forgot the shop,.with their eyes fixed on the wall along which a thin red streak was.slowly flowing down
Go and rot then, good-for-nothing!"..Mother Brulé then planted the whole lump on the end of her stick, and.holding it in the air, bore it about like a banner, rushing along the.road, followed, helter-skelter, by the yelling troop of women
Neither.Étienne nor Maheu nor the others had had time to interfere; they stood.motionless before this gallop of furies
They had not been able to observe.the scene, which was hidden from them by the wall, and they could not.distinguish well in the growing darkness..."What is it they have at the end of that stick?" asked Cécile, who had.grown bold enough to look out...Lucie and Jeanne declared that it must be a rabbit-skin..."No, no," murmured Madame Hennebeau, "they must have been pillaging a.pork butcher's, it seems to be a remnant of a pig."..At this moment she shuddered and was silent
Before the Estaminet Tison, Rasseneur only remained,.feeling relieved, and with open face applauding the easy victory of the.sabres; while in dim and deserted Montsou, in the silence of the closed.houses, the bourgeois remained with perspiring skins and chattering.teeth, not daring to look out
On the contrary, the strike had spread;.Crévecoeur, Mirou, Madeleine, like the Voreux, were producing nothing;.at Feutry-Cantel and the Victoire there were fewer men every morning;.even at Saint-Thomas, which had been hitherto exempt, men were wanting..There was now a silent persistence in the face of this exhibition of.force which exasperated the miners' pride
Maheu had.received his, Levaque also, as well as thirty-four of their mates in.the settlement of the Deux-Cent-Quarante alone
But what completed their.discomfiture was a sermon by the new curé, Abbé Ranvier, that lean.priest with eyes like red-hot coals who had succeeded Abbé Joire
Abbé Ranvier went.so far as to defend these abominable brigands who had dishonoured the.district
Hennebeau, when informed, contented himself with saying, as he.shrugged his shoulders:.."If he troubles us too much the bishop will free us from him."..And while the breath of panic was thus blowing from one end of the.plain to the other, Étienne was dwelling beneath the earth, in.Jeanlin's burrow at the bottom of Réquillart
Jeanlin, who had made himself.purveyor, with the prudence and discretion of a savage and delighted.to make fun of the police, had even brought him pomatum, but could not.succeed in putting his hands on a packet of candles...After the fifth day Étienne never lighted up except to eat
While awaiting something better he would like to be.Pluchart, leaving manual work in order to work only at politics, but.alone, in a clean room, under the pretext that brain labour absorbs the.entire life and needs quiet...At the beginning of the second week, the child having told him that.the police supposed he had gone over to Belgium, Étienne ventured out.of his hole at nightfall
All the fires were out at the Gagebois glass works,.men were continually being sent away from the Sonneville workshops,.only one of the three blast furnaces of the Forges was alight, and not.one battery of coke ovens was burning on the horizon
It was said that.two captains had been buried at the Victoire; there was an inundation.at Feutry-Cantel, it had been necessary to wall up a gallery for the.length of a kilometre at Saint-Thomas, where the ill-kept timbering.was breaking down everywhere
He knew that after the Montsou troubles.there had been great excitement in the Paris journals, quite a violent.controversy between the official newspapers and the opposition.newspapers, terrible narratives, which were especially directed against.the International, of which the empire was becoming afraid after having.first encouraged it; and the directors not daring to turn a deaf ear.any longer, two of them had condescended to come and hold an inquiry,.but with an air of regret, not appearing to care about the upshot; so.disinterested, that in three days they went away again, declaring that.everything was going on as well as possible
Work had not been.resumed at Jean-Bart, and it had been necessary to replace the pump.at Gaston-Marie; while, in spite of all haste, an inundation had.already begun which made great expenses necessary
We had to take the horse to Lepalmec: it nearly broke its.legs at the bottom of the Audierne Hill
Cousin Charles was waiting for.us with sausages, but the women were crying too much, and it stuck in.our throats
Old Bonnemort opposite, his legs bad once more, seemed.to be sleeping; neither Lénore nor Henri had come back from scouring.the roads, in company with Jeanlin, to ask for sous
Since the.strike hunger exasperated their rancour, so that they felt the need.of blows; an altercation between two gossiping women finished by a.murderous onset between their two men...Just then Levaque arrived in his turn, dragging Bouteloup..."Here's our mate; let him just say if he has given twenty sous to my.wife to sleep with her."..The lodger, hiding his timid gentleness in his great beard, protested.and stammered:.."Oh, that? No! Never anything! never!"..At once Levaque became threatening, and thrust his fist beneath Maheu's.nose..."You know that won't do for me
If not, then you believe what she says.".."By God!" exclaimed Maheu, furious at being dragged out of his.dejection, "what is all this clatter again? Haven't we got enough to do.with our misery? Just leave me alone, damn you! or I'll let you know.it! And first, who says that my wife said so?".."Who says so? Pierronne said so."..Maheude broke into a sharp laugh, and turning towards the Levaque woman:.."An! Pierronne, is it? Well! I can tell you what she told me
They.all grew angry, and the Levaques, as a reply to the Maheus, asserted.that Pierronne had said a good many other things on their account; that.they had sold Catherine, that they were all rotten together, even to.the little ones, with a dirty disease caught by Étienne at the Volcan..."She said that! She said that!" yelled Maheu
Excited by the altercation, Maheude was also.going out, when a complaint from Alzire held her back
And that doctor, who.still delayed!..At the Pierrons' door Maheu and the Levaques met Lydie, who was.stamping in the snow
The child replied at first to their.questions with constraint: no, her father was not there, he had gone to.the washhouse to join Mother Brulé and bring back the bundle of linen..Then she was confused, and would not say what her mother was doing..At last she let out everything with a sly, spiteful laugh: her mother.had pushed her out of the door because M
And as the night came on he sent away the policemen,.finding Pierronne alone; then he had remained with her to drink a glass.of gin before a good fire..."Hush! hold your tongue! We must see them," said Levaque, with a lewd.laugh
Maheu immediately addressed him:.."Here! they tell me that your wife says that I sold Catherine, and that.we are all rotten at home
Then there would be an awful scandal,.laughter, and hooting and abuse..."You, who are always saying that other people are dirty!" shouted the.Levaque woman to Pierronne; "it's not surprising that you're clean when.you get the bosses to scour you.".."Ah! it's fine for her to talk!" said Levaque again
"Here's a trollop.who says that my wife sleeps with me and the lodger, one below and the.other above! Yes! yes! that's what they tell me you say."..But Pierronne, grown calm, held her own against this abuse, very.contemptuous in the assurance that she was the best looking and the.richest..."I've said what I've said; just leave me alone, will you! What have my.affairs got to do with you, a pack of jealous creatures who want to get.over us because we are able to save up money! Get along! get along!.You can say what you like; my husband knows well enough why Monsieur.Dansaert was here."..Pierron, in fact, was furiously defending his wife
Maheu and.Levaque rushed on Pierron with their fists, and had to be pulled off...Blood was flowing from her son-in-law's nose, when Mother Brulé, in her.turn, arrived from the washhouse
When informed of what had been going.on, she merely said:.."The damned beast dishonours me!"..The road was becoming deserted, not a shadow spotted the naked.whiteness of the snow, and the settlement, falling back into its.death-like immobility, went on starving beneath the intense cold..."And the doctor?" asked Maheu, as he shut the door..."Not come," replied Maheude, still standing before the window..."Are the little ones back?".."No, not back."..Maheu again began his heavy walk from one wall to the other, looking.like a stricken ox
Vanderhaghen; they recognized the new curé, Abbé Ranvier, who.did not seem surprised at coming on this dead house, without light,.without fire, without bread
But if the workers desired the fair division.of the goods of the earth, they ought at once to put themselves in the.hands of the priests, just as on the death of Jesus the poor and the.humble grouped themselves around the apostles
Then, indeed, there would be a real kingdom of God, every.one recompensed according to his merits, and the law of labour as the.foundation for universal happiness...Maheude, who was listening to him, seemed to hear Étienne, in those.autumn evenings when he announced to them the end of their evils
"And you--nothing new, always from bad.to worse? They tell me that little Négrel has been to Belgium to get.Borains
The spectacle of this agony so overcame him that he tried to.find words to advise submission...But Maheu came violently up to him, shouting:.."Borains! They won't dare, the bloody fools! Let the Borains go down,.then, if they want us to destroy the pits!"..With an air of constraint, Étienne explained that it was not possible.to move, that the soldiers who guarded the pits would protect the.descent of the Belgian workmen
I know.that the pits are suffering much, so that it would probably consent to.an arrangement.".."No, never!" she shouted...Just then Lénore and Henri came back with their hands empty
Étienne heard nothing more in the black room.but Maheude's sobs, repeating her cry for death, that melancholy and.endless lamentation:.."O God! it is my turn, take me! O God! take my man, take the others,.out of pity, to have done with it!".....CHAPTER III...On that Sunday, ever since eight o'clock, Souvarine had been sitting.alone in the parlour of the Avantage, at his accustomed place, with.his head against the wall
Souvarine had gone back to his chair,.with his back to the wall and his eyes fixed on the smoke from his.cigarette, but his feverish fingers were moving restlessly, and he ran.them over his knees, seeking the warm fur of Poland, who was absent.this evening; it was an unconscious discomfort, something that was.lacking, he could not exactly say what...Seated on the other side of the table, Étienne at last said:.."To-morrow work begins again at the Voreux
I met Pluchart the day before yesterday, at.Lille, where I went on business
Then he became very pale, and.his face contracted with nausea; while, in spite of his stoicism, two.large tears were swelling beneath his eyelids...But no one had time to notice this emotion, for the door had opened.roughly and Chaval had appeared, pushing Catherine before him..After having made himself drunk with beer and bluster in all the.public-houses of Montsou, the idea had occurred to him to go to the.Avantage to show his old friends that he was not afraid
I've left Deneulin's dirty shop,.and to-morrow I'm going down to the Voreux with a dozen Belgians, who.have been given me to lead because I'm held in esteem; and if any one.doesn't like that, he can just say so, and we'll talk it over."..Then, as the same contemptuous silence greeted his provocations, he.turned furiously on Catherine..."Will you drink, by God? Drink with me to the confusion of all the.dirty beasts who refuse to work."..She drank, but with so trembling a hand that the two glasses struck.together with a tinkling sound
Then, when he was up, he rushed forward again, his throat.swelling with a savage yell...But Catherine had seen; and in spite of herself a loud cry came from.her heart, astonishing her like the avowal of a preference she had.herself been ignorant of:.."Take care! he's got his knife!"..Étienne had only time to parry the first blow with his arm
On the ground there only.remained the overturned chair and a rain of blood which the sand on the.floor was drinking up......CHAPTER IV...When they came out of Rasseneur's, Étienne and Catherine walked on in.silence
Did he still.desire her, that he felt so troubled, gradually warmed at the heart by.a fresh longing? The recollection of the blows she had dealt him at.Gaston-Marie now attracted him instead of filling him with spite
If her lover married her some.day it would, all the same, be very nice of him...Étienne and Catherine were moving mechanically towards Montsou, and.as they came nearer their silences grew longer
At.first he turned towards Réquillart, sick with fatigue and sadness,.having no other desire except to disappear under the earth and to be.annihilated there
The clouds were galloping by,.whipped on by the strong wind which was blowing up there; but they were.growing white, and ravelling out thinly with the misty transparency.of troubled water over the moon's face
Good night."..In fact, he had given a rendezvous to Bébert and Lydie in a.hiding-place, a hole arranged under the wood supply at the Voreux
The snow was melting; on the soil.there was neither a red patch nor the footmarks of a struggle..."Take the legs!"..Jeanlin took the legs, while Étienne seized the shoulders, after having.fastened the gun behind his back, and then they both slowly descended.the pit-bank, trying to avoid rolling any rocks down
First of all Jeanlin, standing.above, had to let the body slide down, while Étienne, hanging on to.the bushes, had to accompany it to enable it to pass the first two.ladders where the rungs were broken
As soon as Jeanlin reappeared with.the light, Étienne consulted with him, for the child had explored these.old workings, even to the cracks through which men could not pass..They set out again, dragging the dead body for nearly a kilometre,.through a maze of ruinous galleries
It was he who told them of the trick, and they set.out running, while he waited behind the pit-bank, on the towing-path..Six o'clock struck, and the earthy sky was growing pale and lighting up.with a reddish dawn, when the Abbé Ranvier came along a path, holding.up his cassock above his thin legs
There was no work going on.at Jean-Bart, and he had sworn to kill her if she worked again at the.Voreux, where he feared that she would compromise him
Catherine had just recognized the back of Chaval, who was.cautiously going round the pit-bank, when she noticed Lydie and Bébert.putting their noses out of their hiding-place beneath the wood supply..They had passed the night there in ambush, without going home, since.Jeanlin's order was to await him; and while this latter was sleeping.off the drunkenness of his murder at Réquillart, the two children were.lying in each other's arms to keep warm
Lydie did not dare to speak aloud the.sufferings of a small beaten woman, any more than Bébert found courage.to complain of the captain's blows which made his cheeks swell; but.the captain was really abusing his power, risking their bones in mad.marauding expeditions while refusing to share the booty
Barbara's day, when they had eaten fritters and drunk wine...The sudden sound of a bugle made Catherine start
Étienne arrived.running; Bébert and Lydie jumped out of their hiding-place with a leap..And over there, beneath the growing daylight, a band of men and women.were coming from the settlement, gesticulating wildly with anger......CHAPTER V...All the entrances to the Voreux had been closed, and the sixty.soldiers, with grounded arms, were barring the only door left free,.that leading to the receiving-room by a narrow staircase into which.opened the captains' room and the shed
The men had been drawn up in.two lines against the brick wall, so that they could not be attacked.from behind...At first the band of miners from the settlement kept at a distance..They were some thirty at most, and talked together in a violent and.confused way...Maheude, who had arrived first with dishevelled hair beneath a.handkerchief knotted on in haste, and having Estelle asleep in her.arms, repeated in feverish tones:.."Don't let any one in or any one out! Shut them all in there!"..Maheu approved, and just then Father Mouque arrived from Réquillart..They wanted to prevent him from passing
Whispers ran around:.."It's Trompette, isn't it? it's Trompette."..It was, in fact, Trompette
Then, when Trompette, bathed in sweat, lay in agony in his.litter, Bataille had smelled at him despairingly with short sniffs like.sobs
But it was all over;.he would never see his comrade again, and he himself would thus be.tied up in a pitiful bundle on the day when he would ascend up there..His legs began to tremble, the fresh air which came from the distant.country choked him, and he seemed intoxicated when he went heavily back.to the stable...At the surface the colliers stood gloomily before Trompette's carcass..A woman said in a low voice:.."Another man; that may go down if it likes!"..But a new flood arrived from the settlement, and Levaque, who was at.the head followed by his wife and Bouteloup, shouted:.."Kill them, those Borains! No blacklegs here! Kill them! Kill them!"..All rushed forward, and Étienne had to stop them
But it was a false report; only Négrel and Dansaert were.there
He would be.relieved at midday; but fearing that he would not be able to hold out.until then, he had sent a trammer from the pit to Montsou to ask for.reinforcements...Shouts had replied to him:.."Kill the blacklegs! Kill the Borains! We mean to be masters in our own.place!"..Étienne drew back in despair
Maheu and Levaque said furiously to.the soldiers:.."Get off with you! We have nothing against you! Get off with you!".."This doesn't concern you," said Maheude
She had crammed herself in more.closely, with Bébert, and was saying, in a high voice:.."Oh, the pale-livered pigs!"..Catherine, a few paces off, was gazing and listening, stupefied by.new scenes of violence, into the midst of which ill luck seemed to be.always throwing her
It was.Mother Brulé, terrible in her leanness, with her neck and arms in the.air, coming up at such a pace that the wisps of her grey hair blinded.her..."Ah! by God! here I am," she stammered, out of breath; "that traitor.Pierron, who shut me up in the cellar!"..And without waiting she fell on the soldiers, her black mouth belching.abuse..."Pack of scoundrels! dirty scum! ready to lick their masters' boots,.and only brave against poor people!"..Then the others joined her, and there were volleys of insults
They obeyed, and a double row of.steel points was placed in front of the strikers' breasts..."Ah! the bloody swine!" yelled Mother Brulé, drawing back...But already they were coming on again, in excited contempt of death..The women were throwing themselves forward, Maheude and the Levaque.shouting:.."Kill us! Kill us, then! We want our rights!"..Levaque, at the risk of getting cut, had seized three bayonets in his.hands, shaking and pulling them in the effort to snatch them away
In the midst of one group, at.some distance, Zacharie and Philoméne were looking on as at a theatre.so peacefully that they had brought their two children, Achille and.Désirée
The former at once went on, grinning, to slap his friend.Zacharie on the back; while Mouquette, in a very excited condition,.rushed to the first rank of the evil-disposed...Every minute, however, the captain looked down the Montsou road
The soldiers executed the.order, but the disturbance increased, the blustering, and the mockery..."Ah! these shammers, they're going off to the target!" jeered the.women, the Brulé, the Levaque, and the others...Maheude, with her breast covered by the little body of Estelle, who was.awake and crying, came so near that the sergeant asked her what she was.going to do with that poor little brat..."What the devil's that to do with you?" she replied
None believed that they would.fire on them..."There are no balls in their cartridges," said Levaque..."Are we Cossacks?" cried Maheu
With both.hands she raised her skirts, bent her back, and expanded the enormous.rotundity..."Here, that's for you! and it's a lot too clean, you dirty blackguards!"..She ducked and butted so that each might have his share, repeating.after each thrust:.."There's for the officer! there's for the sergeant! there's for the.soldiers!"..A tempest of laughter arose; Bébert and Lydie were in convulsions;.Étienne himself, in spite of his sombre expectation, applauded this.insulting nudity
Négrel and Dansaert, above,.were shouting to the captain to come in and take refuge with them
Every one soon had her ammunition at her feet,.and the battle of stones began...It was Mother Brulé who set to first
Even the youngsters came into line, and Bébert showed Lydie how.the brick ought to be sent from under the elbow
Oh, that was well struck! and that.other, no luck! He joked, and with his elbow pushed Zacharie, who was.squabbling with Philoméne because he had boxed Achille's and Désirée's.ears, refusing to put them on his back so that they could see
And at the top of the slope.near the entrance to the settlement, old Bonnemort appeared, resting on.his stick, motionless against the rust-coloured sky...As soon as the first bricks were thrown, Captain Richomme had again.placed himself between the soldiers and the miners
It was impossible.to hear his words in the midst of the tumult; only his large grey.moustache could be seen moving...But the hail of bricks came faster; the men were joining in, following.the example of the women...Then Maheude noticed that Maheu was standing behind with empty hands.and sombre air..."What's up with you?" she shouted
Bébert and Lydie had fallen one on top of the other.at the first three shots, the little girl struck in the face, the boy.wounded beneath the left shoulder
But he moved, seized her with both arms in the convulsion of his.agony, as if he wanted to take her again, as he had taken her at the.bottom of the black hiding-place where they had spent the past night..And Jeanlin, who just then ran up from Réquillart still half asleep,.kicking about in the midst of the smoke, saw him embrace his little.wife and die...The five other shots had brought down Mother Brulé and Captain.Richomme
A ball entered.Mouquet's mouth and threw him down with fractured skull at the feet of.Zacharie and Philoméne, whose two youngsters were splashed with red.drops
The frightened faces of Négrel and Dansaert could.be seen at the window of the receiving-room
It was Abbé Ranvier, who was coming back after saying mass, and.who, with both arms in the air, with the inspired fury of a prophet,.was calling the wrath of God down on the murderers
He foretold the era.of justice, the approaching extermination of the middle class by fire.from heaven, since it was bringing its crimes to a climax by massacring.the workers and the disinherited of the world......PART SEVEN.....CHAPTER I...The shots fired at Montsou had reached as far as Paris with a.formidable echo
Ah! another.piece of luck, that wound! A fine present, to be able to make children.for the gendarmes to kill; and she never spoke to Catherine, nor did.she, indeed, talk to Étienne
The latter slept with Jeanlin, at the.risk of being arrested, seized by such horror at the idea of going back.to the darkness of Réquillart that he would have preferred a prison..A shudder shook him, the horror of the night after all those deaths,.an unacknowledged fear of the little soldier who slept down there.underneath the rocks
Father Bonnemort occupied.the former bed of the two youngsters, who slept with Catherine now.that poor Alzire no longer dug her hump into her big sister's ribs
And while Lénore and.Henri, to beguile their hunger, were scraping, with deafening noise, an.old saucepan in which cabbages had been boiled the day before, Maheude,.after having placed Estelle on the table, was standing up threatening.Catherine with her fist..."Say that again, by God! Just dare to say that again!"..Catherine had declared her intention to go back to the Voreux
A fine.sum Catherine would bring her! hardly thirty sous, to which they might.add twenty sous if the bosses were good enough to find work for that.brigand Jeanlin
And as the noise of the saucepan was becoming.unbearable, she turned round on Lénore and Henri and boxed their ears..The fall of Estelle, who had been crawling on all fours, increased the.disturbance
He had to pay for famine and death...Zacharie, who came up with Philoméne, hustled Étienne as he went out,.grinning maliciously..."Well, he gets fat
But she joined in with her neighbours with the.idea of getting reconciled with them..."And my mother, eh, and the little girl? You were seen; you were hiding.yourself behind them when they caught the lead instead of you!"..What was to be done? Strangle Pierronne and the others, and fight the.whole settlement? Étienne wanted to do so for a moment
Montsou at his feet, Paris beyond,.becoming a deputy perhaps, crushing the middle class in a speech, the.first speech ever pronounced by a workman in a parliament
They both shrugged their shoulders..They finished up by having a drink together...On the same day there was a great dinner at Piolaine; they were.celebrating the betrothal of Négrel and Cécile
Never had the substantial, patriarchal old house.been in such a state of gaiety...Everything went off beautifully, Madame Hennebeau was charming with.Cécile, and she smiled at Négrel when the Montsou lawyer gallantly.proposed the health of the future household
Hennebeau read a letter from the bishop announcing.Abbé Ranvier's removal
And he only consoled himself a little when.he saw the fine courage of Lucie and Jeanne, who looked charming in.their done-up toilettes, laughing at the downfall, like happy tomboys.disdainful of money...When they passed into the drawing-room for coffee, M
Each of.them seemed to be continuing his own reflections, as though they were.far away from each other..."Have you seen in the paper about Pluchart's success at Paris?" asked.Étienne, at length
He felt contempt for fine.talkers, fellows who go into politics as one goes to the bar, to get an.income out of phrases...Étienne was now studying Darwin
"It will be a fine.time!"..With eyes vaguely fixed on the pit in the shadow, Souvarine quietly.concluded:.."If it does smash up, the mates will know it, since you advise them to.go down again."..Nine o'clock struck at the Montsou steeple; and his companion having.said that he was going to bed, he added, without putting out his hand:.."Well, good-bye
They.had got to know each other, they had toiled together; that always makes.one sad, the idea of not seeing a person again..."You're going away! And where do you go?".."Over there--I don't know at all.".."But I shall see you again?".."No, I think not."..They were silent and remained for a moment facing each other without.finding anything to say..."Then good-bye.".."Good-bye."..While Étienne ascended toward the settlement, Souvarine turned and.again went along the canal bank; and there, now alone, he continued to.walk, with sunken head, so lost in the darkness that he seemed merely.a moving shadow of the night
He distinguished the low breath.of the children, and the snoring of Bonnemort and Maheude; while.Jeanlin near him was breathing with a prolonged flute-like whistle..No doubt he had dreamed, and he was turning back when the noise began.again
He was surprised.to find the young girl sitting up, holding in her breath, awake and on.the watch..."Well! why don't you reply? What are you doing, then?"..At last she said:.."I'm getting up.".."Getting up at this hour?".."Yes, I'm going back to work at the pit."..Étienne felt deeply moved, and sat down on the edge of the palliasse,.while Catherine explained her reasons to him
She woke and.asked drowsily:.."Eh! what is it?"..Catherine had stopped, trembling, and violently pressing Étienne's hand..."It's me; don't trouble yourself," he said
Neither friend nor wife..."Good-bye for good this time.".."Yes, good-bye."..And Souvarine, standing motionless in the darkness, watched Étienne and.Catherine entering the Voreux......CHAPTER III...At four o'clock the descent began
He.took them all, without remark, keeping to the promise of the placards..When, however, he noticed Étienne and Catherine at the wicket, he.started and became very red, and was opening his mouth to refuse their.names; then, he contented himself with the triumph, and a jeer
Ah! ah!.so the strong man was thrown? The Company was, then, in luck since the.terrible Montsou wrestler had come back to it to ask for bread? Étienne.silently took his lamp and went towards the shaft with the putter...But it was there, in the receiving-room, that Catherine feared the.mates' bad words
Catherine and Étienne were squeezed in one tram,.already containing Pierron and two pikemen
When the descent was complete, it.was found that three hundred and twenty-two miners had gone down, about.half of those who worked there when the pit was in full swing...Chaval belonged to the same gang as Catherine and Étienne
Étienne, Chaval, and five others.cleared away the rubbish while Catherine, with two trammers, wheeled.the earth up to the upbrow
Come.along, that doesn't concern you."..But the beast quivered all over his skin, and Mouque forcibly drew him.to the haulage gallery...Almost at the same moment as Mouque and Bataille were disappearing at.the end of a gallery, there was a crackling in the air, followed by.the prolonged noise of a fall
There were.twenty of them; were those bloody bosses going to abandon them thus?.Father Mouque, who had brought back Bataille without hurrying, was.still holding him by the bridle, both of them stupefied, the man and.the beast, in the face of this rapid flow of the inundation
And the twenty yelled with.their faces turned up, obstinately gazing at the shaft like imbeciles,.that shifting hole which was belching out a flood and from which no.help could henceforth come to them...At the surface, Dansaert, on arriving, perceived Négrel running up
And up there on the pit-bank, in Bonnemort's cabin, on.the ground was seated a man, Souvarine, who had not gone away, who was.looking on..."The names! the names!" cried the women, with voices choked by tears...Négrel appeared for a moment, and said hurriedly:.."As soon as we know the names they shall be given out, but nothing is.lost so far: every one will be saved
He had had the cage.unfastened, giving orders to replace it at the end of the cable by a.tub; and as he feared that the water would extinguish his lamp, he had.another fastened beneath the tub, which would protect it...Several captains, trembling and with white, disturbed faces, assisted.in these preparations..."You will come with me, Dansaert," said Négrel, abruptly...Then, when he saw them all without courage, and that the head captain.was tottering, giddy with terror, he pushed him aside with a movement.of contempt..."No, you will be in my way
Yes, yes, Catherine was among them, Étienne also--a mate had seen.them
The Levaque.and Pierronne, although none of their people were in danger, cried out.and lamented as loudly as the others
Zacharie, who had come up among.the first, in spite of his inclination to make fun of everything had.weepingly kissed his wife and mother, and remained near the latter,.quivering, and showing an unexpected degree of affection for his.sister, refusing to believe that she was below so long as the bosses.made no authoritative statement..."The names! the names! For pity's sake, the names!"..Négrel, who was exhausted, shouted to the overseers:.."Can't you make them be still? It's enough to kill one with vexation!.We don't know the names!"..Two hours passed away in this manner
Hennebeau, Négrel, and other.engineers who had hastened up, formed a group in black coats and hats.standing in front of the crowd; and they, too, did not move away,.though their legs were aching with fatigue, and they were feverish and.ill at their impotence in the face of such a disaster, only whispering.occasional words as though at a dying person's bedside
He had recognized.Maheude and Zacharie sobbing before this downfall, the weight of which.was so heavy on the heads of the wretches who were in agony beneath..And he threw down his last cigarette; he went away, without looking.back, into the now dark night
At.what spot should they cut into the bed? Towards whom should they go,.since no once appeared to be there? They persisted in seeking, however,.notwithstanding the exhaustion produced by their growing anxiety...On the first day, Maheude came in the morning to Réquillart
At first, Philoméne had also come, accompanying Zacharie, who.was one of the gang; then she became wearied at catching cold, without.need or result, and went back to the settlement, dragging through her.days, a limp, indifferent woman, occupied from morning to night in.coughing
At midday, after lunch, when he came back with.his men to make one last effort, he was surprised to see Zacharie, red.and gesticulating, come out of the mine shouting:.."She's there! She's replied to me! Come along, quickly!"..He had slid down the ladders, in spite of the watchman, and was.declaring that he had heard hammering over there, in the first passage.of the Guillaume seam..."But we have already been twice in that direction," Négrel observed,.sceptically
Négrel decided to begin at.once the work of approach...When Zacharie, up above, saw Maheude again, they embraced each other..."It won't do to get excited," Pierronne, who had come for a visit of.inquisitiveness, was cruel enough to say
"If Catherine isn't there, it.would be such a grief afterwards!"..That was true; Catherine might be somewhere else..."Just leave me alone, will you? Damn it!" cried Zacharie in a rage.."She's there; I know it!"..Maheude sat down again in silence, with motionless face, continuing to.wait...As soon as the story was spread at Montsou, a new crowd arrived..Nothing was to be seen; but they remained there all the same, and had.to be kept at a distance
Négrel, who had come up for a moment, was not.there to make him obey, and only a captain and three miners were below..No doubt Zacharie, infuriated with the feeble vacillating light,.which delayed his work, committed the imprudence of opening his lamp,.although severe orders had been given, for leakages of fire-damp had.taken place, and the gas remained in enormous masses in these narrow,.unventilated passages
The inquisitive fled, and Maheude arose, pressing the.frightened Estelle to her breast...When Négrel and the men came back they were seized by a terrible.rage
One of the three miners was the man who had smashed the.pump at Gaston-Marie with a final blow of the shovel during the strike;.the two others still had scars on their hands, and grazed, torn fingers.from the energy with which they had thrown bricks at the soldiers
They arranged a party, and it was agreed.that they should go to the Voreux in their carriage, while Madame.Hennebeau took Lucie and Jeanne there in hers
Finally, they would dine together in the evening...When the Grégoires and their daughter Cécile arrived at the ruined.mine, toward three o'clock, they found Madame Hennebeau already there,.in a sea-blue dress, protecting herself under her parasol from the pale.February sun
No, they would rather think of.something else; this destruction was only good to give bad dreams..."Let us go," said Madame Hennebeau, turning towards her carriage...Lucie and Jeanne protested
Go on, go on! we shall be at Réquillart as soon as you."..He got up behind Madame Grégoire and Cécile, and while the other.carriage went along by the canal, theirs gently ascended the slope...Their excursion was to be completed by a visit of charity
At last she thought of a pretext;.she praised Henri and Lénore, who were so good, so gentle, and so.intelligent, answering like angels the questions that they were asked..They would tell the lady and gentleman all that they wished to know..."Will you come for a moment, my child?" asked the father, glad to get.away..."Yes, I'll follow you," she replied...Cécile remained alone with Bonnemort
Their idolized daughter, that daughter desired so long, on whom.they had lavished all their goods, whom they used to watch sleeping,.on tiptoe, whom they never thought sufficiently well nourished, never.sufficiently plump! It was the downfall of their very life; what was.the good of living, now that they would have to live without her?..The Levaque woman in distraction cried:.."Ah, the old beggar! what's he done there? Who would have expected such.a thing? And Maheude, who won't come back till evening! Shall I go and.fetch her?"..The father and mother were crushed, and did not reply..."Eh? It will be better
Behind the engineer, Maheude, seated on the beam, was.listening with white face, when the Levaque woman came up and told her.the old man's strange deed
What an abomination! That poor.Cécile, so merry that very day, so full of life an hour before! M..Hennebeau had to lead his wife for a moment into old Mouque's hovel..With his awkward hands he unfastened her dress, troubled by the odour.of musk which her open bodice exhaled
At every.bifurcation they were pulled up short by uncertainty, and yet they had.to decide...Étienne was running last, delayed by Catherine, who was paralysed by.fatigue and fear
Their only remaining hope was to gain the upper workings,.from which they might perhaps be delivered if the water sank...Étienne at last recognized the Guillaume seam..."Good!" he exclaimed
From every side the mine.seemed to be pressing on to him to take him and to stifle him...Then Étienne and Catherine, as he came near them, perceived that he.was strangling between the rocks
It was.a terrifying uproar of interior cataclysms, a remnant of the ancient.battle when deluges overthrew the earth, burying the mountains beneath.the plains...And Catherine, shaken and dazed by this continuous downfall, joined her.hands, stammering the same words without cessation:.."I don't want to die! I don't want to die!"..To reassure her, Étienne declared that the water was not now moving..Their flight had lasted for fully six hours, and they would soon be.rescued
Catherine was lying down near.Étienne, restless under the glances of her former lover
They stretched themselves out again, and the hours continued.to pass by...A noise aroused Étienne and Catherine, and they raised their.heads
Darkness was invading the walled-up cave, and this body,.lying on the earth, looked like the black boss of a mass of rough coal...Leaning over, with wide eyes, Étienne looked at him
Now he, too, had killed...But Catherine, standing erect, uttered a loud cry:.."My God! he is dead!".."Are you sorry?" asked Étienne, fiercely...She was choking, she stammered
There was now complete and.absolute night, that night of the earth which they would have to sleep.through without ever again opening their eyes to the brightness of the.sun..."By God!" Étienne swore, in a low voice...Catherine, as though she had felt the darkness seize her, sheltered.herself against him
Besides, who would hear them?..Catherine was leaning her aching head against the seam, when she sat up.with a start..."Listen!" she said...At first Étienne thought she was speaking of the low noise of the.ever-rising water
No doubt they.would have succumbed if they had not had as much water as they desired..They merely bent down and drank from the hollow of the hand, and that.very frequently, parched by a thirst which all this water could not.quench...On the seventh day Catherine was bending down to drink, when her hand.struck some floating body before her..."I say, look! What's this?"..Étienne felt in the darkness..."I can't make out; it seems like the cover of a ventilation door."..She drank, but as she was drawing up a second mouthful the body came.back, striking her hand
Her perverted senses now increased the.horror of it; her childish superstitions came back to her; she saw the.Black Man, the old dead miner who returns to the pit to twist naughty.girls' necks..."Listen! did you hear?".."No, nothing; I heard nothing.".."Yes, the Man--you know? Look! he is there
It was an.immense sadness, the misery of generations, the extremity of grief into.which life can fall...At the surface, Maheude, stricken down near dead Catherine, uttered.a cry, then another, then another--very long, deep, incessant moans..Several corpses had already been brought up, and placed in a row on.the ground: Chaval, who was thought to have been crushed beneath a.landslip, a trammer, and two hewers, also crushed, with brainless.skulls and bellies swollen with water
He had already received a letter from Pluchart, calling.him to Paris, and enclosing money for the journey
Work was beginning again.everywhere, at Mirou, at Madeleine, at Crévecoeur, at the Victoire..Everywhere, in the morning haze, along the roads lost in darkness, the.flock was tramping on, rows of men trotting with faces bent towards the.earth, like cattle led to the slaughter-house
It was an endless rustling, a general downfall, the forced.march of a beaten army, moving on with lowered heads, sullenly absorbed.in the desire to renew the struggle and achieve revenge...When Étienne arrived, Jean-Bart was emerging from the shade; the.lanterns, hooked on to the platform, were still burning in the.growing dawn
A cage was embarking its men, and the batch disappeared; as.others arrived he saw at last one of his lieutenants in the strike, a.worthy fellow who had sworn to die..."You too!" he murmured, with aching heart...The other turned pale and his lips trembled; then, with a movement of.excuse:.."What would you have? I've got a wife."..Now in the new crowd coming from the shed he recognized them all..."You too!--you too!--you too!"..And all shrank back, stammering in choked voices:.."I have a mother."--"I have children."--"One must get bread."..The cage did not reappear; they waited for it mournfully, with such.sorrow at their defeat that they avoided meeting each other's eyes,.obstinately gazing at the shaft..."And Maheude?" Étienne asked...They made no reply
Then, as he moved away, under the pretext of.giving an order, he said at last:.."Eh! Maheude? There she is."..In fact, Maheude had reached the shed with her lamp in her hand,.dressed in trousers and jacket, with her head confined in the cap
If there were not six of us we should get enough to eat..Estelle devours now, and the worst is that it will be four or five.years before Lénore and Henri are old enough to come to the pit."..Étienne could not restrain a movement of pain..."They, too!"..Maheude's pale cheeks turned red, and her eyes flamed
At Paris I can.arrange for myself."..Two more cages had gone down, and Pierron decided to speak straight to.Maheude..."I say now, over there, they are waiting for you! Is that little chat.nearly done?"..But she turned her back
Levaque is still in prison;.Bouteloup is taking his place meanwhile.".."Ah, yes! Bouteloup.".."And, listen! did I tell you? Philoméne has gone away.".."What! gone away?".."Yes, gone away with a Pas-de-Calais miner
The.joy of rejoining Pluchart and of being, like Pluchart, a leader who was.listened to, inspired him with speeches, and he began to arrange the.phrases
Little red.clouds, the last vapours of the night, were melting in the limpid.blue; and the vague faces of Souvarine and Rasseneur came to his.memory
This time a push only had been given to a ruinous society, but.they had heard the rumbling beneath their feet, and they felt more.shocks arising, and still more, until the old edifice would be crushed,.fallen in and swallowed, going down like the Voreux to the abyss...Étienne took the Joiselle road, to the left
He remembered that he had.prevented the band from rushing on to Gaston-Marie
Yes, Maheude had well said,.with her good sense, that that would be the great blow--to organize.quietly, to know one another, to unite in associations when the laws.would permit it; then, on the morning when they felt their strength,.and millions of workers would be face to face with a few thousand.idlers, to take the power into their own hands and become the masters..Ah! what a reawakening of truth and justice! The sated and crouching.god would at once get his death-blow, the monstrous idol hidden in the.depths of his sanctuary, in that unknown distance where poor wretches.fed him with their flesh without ever having seen him...But Étienne, leaving the Vandame road, now came on to the paved street..On the right he saw Montsou, which was lost in the valley
Then there were the other pits at the horizon, the.Victoire, Saint-Thomas, Feutry-Cantel; while, towards the north, the.tall chimneys of the blast furnaces, and the batteries of coke ovens,.were smoking in the transparent morning air
Men were springing forth, a black avenging army, germinating.slowly in the furrows, growing towards the harvests of the next.century, and their germination would soon overturn the earth........End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Germinal, by Émile Zola..*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK GERMINAL ***..***** This file should be named 56528-8.txt or 56528-8.zip *****.This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

 AND IN NEW YORK
 BY HER LADYSHIP'S MOST DEVOTED
 ENGLISH BLANK VERSE.....BOOK I..ARGUMENT..In a council of the Gods, Minerva calls their attention to Ulysses, still.a wanderer
   Godlike Ulysses to his native shores.
   Daughter of sapient Atlas, who the abyss
   Earth-circling Neptune--He it is whose wrath
   For Him, Thoösa bore, Nymph of the sea                            90
   Ere long, in rush'd the suitors, and the thrones
   The Hero old Laertes will avouch,
   Son of himself Ulysses? for thy face
   Ere yet he went to Troy, the mark to which
     Whom answered thus Telemachus discrete.
It was a sort of Lex Talionis which.Telemachus hoped might be put in force against them; and that Jove would.demand no satisfaction for the lives of those who made him none for the.waste of his property......BOOK II..ARGUMENT..Telemachus having convened an assembly of the Greecians, publicly calls.on the Suitors to relinquish the house of Ulysses
   The Hero, old Ægyptius; bow'd with age
     Hear me, ye men of Ithaca, my friends!
     He ended, and Telemachus rejoiced
   I pray you by Olympian Jove, by her
   Long time, none dared to greet Telemachus
     Ye men of Ithaca, give ear! hear all!
   Long-time contented an enquirer here,
     Thus saying, Liocritus dissolved in haste
   Whom, thither call'd, Telemachus address'd.
     Whom, prudent, thus answer'd Telemachus.
   Had brighten'd into day, cleaved swift the flood....FOOTNOTES:..[6] The reader is to be reminded that this is not an assembly of the.suitors only, but a general one, which affords Telemachus an opportunity.to apply himself to the feelings of the Ithacans at large......BOOK III..ARGUMENT..Telemachus arriving at Pylus, enquires of Nestor concerning Ulysses..Nestor relates to him all that he knows or has heard of the Greecians.since their departure from the siege of Troy, but not being able to give.him any satisfactory account of Ulysses, refers him to Menelaus
At.evening Minerva quits Telemachus, but discovers herself in going
Nestor.sacrifices to the Goddess, and the solemnity ended, Telemachus sets forth.for Sparta in one of Nestor's chariots, and accompanied by Nestor's son,.Pisistratus...
   City of Neleus
   Ah Mentor! how can I advance, how greet
     Oh guest! the King of Ocean now adore!
   Grant also to Telemachus and me
     Oh Nestor, Neleus' son, glory of Greece!
     Then Nestor thus Gerenian Hero old.
   There warlike Ajax lies, there Peleus' son;
   Devised against them, and Saturnian Jove
   Maintaining, till at length, uprose the Greeks
   With Agamemnon, son of Atreus, stay'd
   Fled thence in haste, and warlike Diomede
   Oh Nestor, Neleus' son, glory of Greece!
     To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied.
   Lay before Ilium; he, the while, secure                          340
   Led Clytemnestra
   Phæstus by name, the South wind rolls the surge                  380
   Godlike Telemachus and Pallas both
     Forbid it, Jove, and all the Pow'rs of heav'n!
   Than Jove's own daughter Pallas, who among
   Broad-fronted, one that never yet hath borne
     So Nestor pray'd, whom Pallas gracious heard.
   Whom Nestor welcom'd, charging high the cup
   And to the daughter of Jove Ægis-arm'd
   Gerenian Nestor issued forth, and sat
   Echephron, Stratius, Perseus, Thrasymedes,
   Godlike Telemachus at Nestor's side,
   Burst from his twofold hedge of teeth."..[8] It is said to have been customary in the days of Homer, when the.Greeks retired from a banquet to their beds, to cut out the tongues of.the victims, and offer them to the Gods in particular who presided over.conversation......BOOK IV..ARGUMENT..Telemachus, with Pisistratus, arrives at the palace of Menelaus, from.whom he receives some fresh information concerning the return of the.Greecians, and is in particular told on the authority of Proteus, that.his father is detained by Calypso
The suitors, plotting against the life.of Telemachus, lie in wait to intercept him in his return to Ithaca..Penelope being informed of his departure, and of their designs to slay.him, becomes inconsolable, but is relieved by a dream sent to her from.Minerva...
   Achilles' offspring, ruled the Myrmidons.
     Dearest Pisistratus, observe, my friend!
   Discrete Penelope, nor less his son
   Ye Gods! the offspring of indeed a friend
   And much I purpos'd, had Olympian Jove
   Nor Nestor's son with tearless eyes remain'd,
   Of such a father, whom Saturnian Jove                            260
     Atrides! Menelaus! dear to Jove!
   Thou thither cam'st, impell'd, as it should seem,
   Godlike Deiphobus
     He ceas'd; then Argive Helen gave command
     Hero! Telemachus! what urgent cause
   Hard task for mortal hands to bind a God!
     Oh Atreus' son, by what confed'rate God
   All safe, whom Nestor left and I, at Troy?
   Long time; for though contented I could sit
     He said; the Hero Menelaus smiled,
     Ye Gods, a proud exploit is here atchieved,
   Into Ulysses' house at once they throng'd.
   Swift to Penelope the tale he bore,
   Ah treach'rous servants! conscious as ye were
     Hear matchless daughter of Jove Ægis-arm'd!
